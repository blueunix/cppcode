<A NAME="HDR.7">
CATALOG DIRECTORY
</A>
</H1>
The built-in style rules in
<STRONG>html-pretty</STRONG>,
together with the three default startup style files, and the
<STRONG>-extend-style</STRONG><EM> class: taglist</EM>
and
<STRONG>-stylefile</STRONG><EM> stylefile</EM>
options suffice for most uses of the prettyprinter.
<P>
However, it may be useful to offer a simpler interface that only
requires the user to specify the desired grammar level with the
<STRONG>-grammar-level</STRONG><EM> grammar</EM>
option, and have
<STRONG>html-pretty</STRONG>
automatically find the style files.  Thus, when the
<STRONG>-grammar-level</STRONG>
option is used,
<STRONG>html-pretty</STRONG>
looks for a catalog directory that contains a file named
<EM>catalog</EM>,
and one or more style files.
<P>
The catalog directory is searched for in the same path as the executable
file, but in a path starting one level higher.  On UNIX, it is usually
called
<EM>share/lib/&lt;programname&gt;</EM>,
so if the executable program was
<EM>/usr/local/bin/html-pretty</EM>,
the catalog directory is
<EM>/usr/local/share/lib/html-pretty</EM>.
[Conventionally, on UNIX systems, directories in the
<EM>share</EM>
directory tree are shared across multiple O/S releases and vendor
architectures.]
<P>
On other operating systems, the
<EM>share</EM>
portion of the path may be omitted.  However, the quickest way to find
out where the catalog directory resides on your system is to run
<STRONG>html-pretty</STRONG>
with the
<STRONG>-grammar-level</STRONG>
and
<STRONG>-trace-opens</STRONG>
options, to trace the file-opening attempts.
<P>
The
<EM>catalog</EM>
file has a simple format: each non-empty line contains a grammar
level, and a corresponding filename in that directory.  As with style
files, comments run from percent (%) to end-of-line, but there is no
support for line continuation, since the lines are all very short.  To
get a literal percent or quotation mark into a value, prefix it with a
backslash; the backslash will be removed when the value is collected.
<P>
This indirect mapping of grammar level to style file means that end
users need not know the style file names, and thus, that the names can
be changed to meet local requirements.
<P>
SGML parsers and other SGML software use a similar catalog file to map
DTD descriptor strings to local filenames.
<P>
Lettercase is
<EM>not</EM>
significant in grammar-level names, although it may be for filenames.
The standard style files are all named in a single lettercase, so that
the catalog entries work on all file systems.
<P>
If you are developing a new set of styles, you probably do not want
them put in the system-wide catalog directory until they have been
completed and debugged. In such a case, you can use the
<STRONG>-catalogfile</STRONG>
option to specify an alternate catalog file location.  Once they are
ready for wider release, you (or your system manager) can merge your
<EM>catalog</EM>
file with the system one, and copy your style files into the system
catalog directory.
