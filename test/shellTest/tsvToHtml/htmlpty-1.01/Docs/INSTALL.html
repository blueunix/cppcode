            You can build and install <SAMP>html-pretty</SAMP> on UNIX

        <P>
            On systems with unusual compiler names (e.g., HAL
            SPARC64/OS_2.4.5), you may need to specify a C and C++
            compiler to use; see the <VAR>CC</VAR> = and <VAR>CCC</VAR>
            = options to <SAMP>env</SAMP> in the example below.
        </P>
        <P>
            NB:  you can safely ignore this warning [your line number
            may differ]:

</PRE>
        <P>
            That rule is there intentionally, to avoid losing output in
            the event earlier rules fail to match all possible input
            patterns.
        </P>
        <P>
            If you want to repeat the process in the same directory, but
            for a different architecture, first do
        </P>
<PRE>
    make distclean
</PRE>
        <P>
            to restore the directory to the state of a fresh
            distribution, then repeat the configure and make steps as
            before.
        </P>
        <P>
            If the builds, checks, and installs were successful, you can

        </P>
        <HR>
        <P>
            The configure script will create <SAMP>Makefile</SAMP> from
            <SAMP>Makefile</SAMP> .in, and <SAMP>config.h</SAMP> from
            <SAMP>config.hin</SAMP>, an essential step before make and
            compilers can be used.
        </P>
        <P>
            There are no top-level <SAMP>Makefile</SAMP> and
            <SAMP>config.h</SAMP> files included in a new distribution,
            since <SAMP>configure</SAMP> is expected to generate them.
            However, for safety, there are backup copies of
            <SAMP>Makefile</SAMP>, <SAMP>config.h</SAMP>,
            <SAMP>configure </SAMP>, and <SAMP>htmlpty.c</SAMP> in the
            <SAMP>Backup </SAMP> subdirectory; they were prepared on a
            Sun Solaris 2.5 system.  You can use copies of them should
            you experience problems with configure, or if you are
            porting the software to a non-UNIX system that does not have
            a POSIX- or UNIX-like shell (several non-UNIX systems have
            such shells, including IBM PC DOS, IBM VM/CMS, and Microsoft
            Windows NT).
        </P>
        <P>
            If you wish to use a particular C and/or C++ compiler and
            optimization level, do it like this:
        </P>
<PRE>
    env CC=..C-compiler.. CCC=..C++-compiler.. ./configure &amp;&amp; \
        make OPT='-optlevel' all check install
</PRE>
        <P>
            or if your system lacks the <SAMP>env</SAMP> command
        </P>
<PRE>
    sh/ksh/bash shell:
    CC=..C-compiler.. CCC=..C++-compiler.. ./configure &amp;&amp; \
        make OPT='-optlevel' all check install

    csh/tcsh shell:
    setenv CC ..C-compiler..
    setenv CCC ..C++-compiler..
    ./configure &amp;&amp; make OPT='-optlevel' all check install
</PRE>
        <P>
            You do not need to rerun <SAMP>configure</SAMP> if you only
            change optimization levels, but you should do if you change
            other compiler options, since they may affect the visibility
            of symbols and declarations in system header files, and that
            in turn may require (automated) changes to the
            <SAMP>config.h</SAMP> file.
        </P>
        <P>
            In the <SAMP>Makefile</SAMP>, you may want to change the
            definitions of the <SAMP>BINDIR</SAMP> and <SAMP>MANDIR
            </SAMP> installation directories; the distribution version
            uses the Free Software Foundation's standards of
            <SAMP>/usr/local/bin</SAMP> and <SAMP>/usr/local/man</SAMP>,
            which avoids contaminating any vendor-provided directories.
            This is readily done on the <SAMP>make</SAMP> command-line,
            like this:
        </P>
<PRE>
     make prefix=/some/other/place targets
</PRE>
        <P>
            or, better, at <SAMP>configure</SAMP> time, like this:
        </P>
<PRE>
     ./configure --prefix=/some/other/place

        </H1>
        <P>
            The <SAMP>Makefile</SAMP> contains about 60 convenience
            targets for picking particular compilers and optimization
            levels on different UNIX systems.  If you use them, be sure
            to run <SAMP>configure</SAMP> first with <VAR>CC</VAR> set
            to choose the appropriate compiler.
        </P>
        <P>
            In the <SAMP>Makefile</SAMP>, read carefully the comments on
            the merits of choosing <SAMP>lex</SAMP> or <SAMP>flex</SAMP>
            ;
            <SAMP>flex</SAMP> is the default for the reasons stated
            there, but <SAMP>lex</SAMP> can be used on <EM>some</EM>,
            but not all, UNIX systems.  Although <SAMP>flex</SAMP>
            usuually produces faster lexical analyzers than <SAMP>lex
            </SAMP>, for <SAMP>html-pretty</SAMP> 1.00, the <SAMP>lex
            </SAMP> version is slightly faster.  However, because the
            <SAMP>lex</SAMP> version has problems with some characters
            in the range 128..255 on some systems, <SAMP>flex</SAMP> is
            still the default lexical analyzer generator.
        </P>
        <P>
            On HP 9000/7xx HP-UX 10.01 systems, and possibly others, it
            is necessary to force <CODE>yytext</CODE> to be an array
            rather than a pointer; this is done by adding
            <KBD>-DYYCHAR_ARRAY</KBD> to the compilation options, e.g.,
        </P>
<PRE>
        make XCFLAGS=-DYYCHAR_ARRAY
</PRE>
        <P>
            Because some <SAMP>lex</SAMP> implementations allocate
            peculiar sizes for <CODE>yytext[]</CODE>, <SAMP>html-pretty
            </SAMP> checks at startup that the expected size matches the
            actual size, and if they differ, it quits immediately with a
            message like this:
        </P>
<PRE>
**********************************************************************
** FATAL ERROR: This program has inconsistent array sizes:
**      YYLMAX = 8192
**      sizeof(yytext) = 0
** You must correct the lex-generated code and rebuild the program.
** The Makefile has a sed filter step that should correct the error.
** Did you override this by running lex manually?
**********************************************************************
</PRE>
        <P>
            As the message notes, the installation procedure tries to
            correct such abberrations, but may not succeed on all
            systems.
        </P>
        <P>
            In the <SAMP>Makefile</SAMP>, pick the appropriate
            definition of <SAMP>HOST</SAMP>, or if neither works (highly
            unlikely in the Internet world), you can specify it on the
            make command line with something like
        </P>
<PRE>
        make HOST=-D\&quot;foo.bar.baz\&quot;
</PRE>
        <P>
            Then just type
        </P>
<PRE>
        make
</PRE>
        <P>
            On Sun Solaris 2.x, with the default vendor C compiler, you
            may need to type
        </P>
<PRE>
        make CC='cc -Xc'
</PRE>
        <P>
            because <SAMP>flex</SAMP> -generated code otherwise defines
            <SAMP>const</SAMP> to an empty string after including some
            system header files, and before including others.  The
            result is function prototype name conflicts for names
            declared in multiple header files (e.g., <SAMP>rename()
            </SAMP>).  The <KBD>-Xc</KBD> option requests strict
            Standard C compilation, and avoids the problem.
        </P>
        <P>
            On some systems (e.g. HP-UX with c89), you may need to add
            <KBD>-D_POSIX_SOURCE</KBD> in order to get the <SAMP>utsname
            </SAMP> structures visible.
        </P>
        <P>
            <SAMP>html-pretty</SAMP> has been successfully built and
            tested on these systems:

        <P>
            With <SAMP>lex</SAMP>, some implementations lose characters

        <P>
            On other systems, please try a C++ compiler if you have one,

            do. <SAMP>flex</SAMP> -generated code is C++ compatible, but
            some vendor <SAMP>lex</SAMP> implementations are still in
            the old K&amp;R C mold, instead of conforming to 1989
            ANSI/ISO Standard C, and produce C code that cannot be
            compiled with C++ compilers.
        </P>
        <P>
            To build, check, and install <SAMP>html-pretty</SAMP>, just

            Installation will not happen if any of the validation checks

        <P>
            It you want to change the default compiler optimization
            level, set the variable <VAR>OPT</VAR> on the command line.
            Other compiler flags can be supplied with the <VAR>XCFLAGS

            individually.  The copy loop ran in 3.21 sec, and the time
            ratio is 3.34.  The output file size is 3.3MB, so adjusting
            for the total number of bytes input and output, this ratio
            can be further scaled down by (2399316 + 3295133)/(2 *
            2399316) = 0.69, to a value of 2.29.

        <P>
            <SAMP>flex</SAMP> offers options for improved scanner
            efficiency, notably, uncompressed tables, and fullword,
            instead of halfword, storage.  Here is a comparison of the
            relative run times on a Sun SPARCstation LX with the native
            Solaris 2.4 C compiler, using the 2.4MB test file noted
            above:
        </P>
<PRE>
                ------------------------------------
                LFLAGS                  -----OPT----
                                        -g      -xO4
                ------------------------------------
                (slow)                  2.42    1.23

                ------------------------------------
</PRE>
        <P>
            The tradeoff is that the fast scanner has 3.65 times as many
            lines of C code, 4.10 times as many bytes of C code, and the
            executable is 6.28 times larger.  Compilation of the slow
            scanner with optimization took 4 minutes, and of the fast
            scanner, 6 minutes.
        </P>
        <P>
            However, use of the fast scanner uncovered two problems:
        </P>
        <OL>
            <LI>
                in function <CODE>yy_try_NUL_trans()</CODE>, the
                generated code was missing a variable declaration:
<PRE>
                register char *yy_cp = yy_c_buf_p; /* BUG: lost with -Cf -Ca */
</PRE>
                This is a <SAMP>flex</SAMP> 2.5.1 bug that will be
                reported to the <SAMP>flex</SAMP> author.
            </LI>
            <LI>
                <KBD>make check</KBD> failed in <SAMP>check005</SAMP>:
                three lines with characters in 128..255 are missing a
                blank preceding those characters.
            </LI>
        </OL>
        <P>
            Thus, I will not use the fast scanner options until these
            problems are fixed.
        </P>
        <P>
            [08-Nov-1997]:  Under <SAMP>flex</SAMP> version 2.5.4, I
            repeated this experiment, this time on a faster Sun
            UltraSPARC 2170 using the native Solaris 2.5.1 C++ compiler.

            The compilation and link time for <KBD>make all</KBD> with
            <KBD>OPT=-g</KBD> was 13.05sec, and with <KBD>OPT=-O4</KBD>,
            185.58 sec, 14.22 times longer.
        </P>
        <P>
            The <SAMP>htmlpty.c</SAMP> file was 6231 lines and 179583
            bytes long with the fast flex options <KBD>-Ca -Cf</KBD>,
            compared to 5220 lines and 130535 bytes without.
        </P>
        <P>
            The executable size for the fast <SAMP>flex</SAMP> version
            with <KBD>OPT=-O4</KBD> was 395440 bytes (382280 bytes
            stripped of symbols) compared with 425984 bytes (391632
            bytes stripped of symbols) with <KBD>OPT=-g</KBD>.

        <P>
            Although bug (1) above has disappeared, the <KBD>make check

            </A>
        </H1>
        <P>
            During the development of version 1.00, considerable
            attention was given to improving the efficiency of the
            program.  Because it does much more than earlier versions,
            it is not as fast (compared to the <SAMP>cpchar</SAMP>
            program, it runs ?.??  times slower), but I believe the code
            is now acceptably fast, and further changes to the code are
            not likely to make much difference.
        </P>
        <P>
            In particular, I was concerned about the efficiency of
            low-level I/O routines, and the linear search through tag
            tables, called from <CODE>do_tag()</CODE> -&gt;
            <CODE>check_tag_nesting()</CODE> -&gt; <CODE>search()</CODE>
            when the <STRONG>-check-tag-nesting</STRONG> option has been
            specified.
        </P>
        <P>
            Hash table searches are used elsewhere in the program for
            class/tag lookups, and could be used by
            <CODE>check_tag_nesting()</CODE> as well, at the cost of
            some additional complexity in table allocation, generation,
            and freeing.  Fortunately, this does not seem to be
            necessary, thanks to some rather simple optimizations that
            avoid unnecessary <CODE>strxxx()</CODE> library function
            calls.  One of them, a 3-line change in <SAMP>table.c</SAMP>
            in function <CODE>get_name_by_style()</CODE> and
            <CODE>struct Style</CODE>, reduced execution time by 40%.
        </P>
        <P>
            The low-level I/O routines have been rewritten to replace
            the old double buffered scheme (old output + current line)
            with a new single buffered approach that uses two variables,
            <VAR>big_last_verbatim_position</VAR> and <VAR>
            big_newline_position</VAR>, to track the buffer positions of
            two critical fenceposts.  This optimization also reduced
            complexity, making the time-critical <CODE>dputc()</CODE>
            function a candidate for inlining:  every output character
            goes through that function.
        </P>
        <P>
            With C++ compilation, several short functions are now
            compiled inline (they are identified by the <CODE>INLINE
            </CODE> attribute, which is defined in <SAMP>common.h</SAMP>
            to expand to <CODE>inline</CODE> in C++ compilation, and to
            an empty string in C compilation).
        </P>
        <P>
            Profiling with <SAMP>prof</SAMP>, <SAMP>gprof</SAMP>,
            <SAMP>pixie</SAMP>, <SAMP>pixstats</SAMP>, and
            <SAMP>tcov</SAMP> on several architectures now shows that
            the time critical code section is the <CODE>yy_match</CODE>
            loop in <CODE>yylex()</CODE>, and the
            <CODE>yy_get_next_buffer()</CODE> function, which together
            account for 40% to 70% of the run time, depending on the
            architecture.  Since they are part of the
            <SAMP>flex</SAMP>-generated code, nothing can be readily
            done to improve them, short of changing to a faster lexical
            analyzer, but as far as I'm aware, no one so far has claimed
            to improve on <SAMP>flex</SAMP>.

            Clearly, on all three systems, I/O is the chief consumer of
            CPU time.
        </P>
        <P>
            To that end, I made some additional changes in the code to
            reduce the number of system calls for I/O, by redimensioning
            the <VAR>big_buffer[]</VAR> array from <VAR>MAXBUF</VAR> to
            <VAR>MAXBIGBUF</VAR>, and then adding calls in <CODE>main()
            </CODE> to <CODE>setvbuf()</CODE> (when available) to
            allocate input and output buffers, also of size <VAR>
            MAXBIGBUF</VAR> (default:  max(16384, <VAR>MAXBUF</VAR>)).

            Sun Solaris 2.5 systems with <VAR>MAXBIGBUF</VAR> values of
            2048, 4096, 16384, 65536, 262144, and 1048576 showed little
            change in run times with a 5MB test input file.  The HP
            system had the largest reduction, only about 5%, as <VAR>
            MAXBIGBUF</VAR> increased.
        </P>
        <P>
            I also made additional experiments with function inlining:
            choosing the top 15 time consumers from profiles
            <CODE>(blank()</CODE>, <CODE>copy_verbatim()</CODE>,
            <CODE>dputc() </CODE>, <CODE>indentation_size()</CODE>,
            <CODE>last_char() </CODE>, <CODE>normalize_tag()</CODE>,
            <CODE>out_blank() </CODE>, <CODE>out_char()</CODE>,
            <CODE>out_string()</CODE>, <CODE>out_verbatim_char()</CODE>,
            <CODE>out_verbatim_string()</CODE>,
            <CODE>out_yytext()</CODE>, <CODE>trim_line()</CODE>,
            <CODE>yyinput()</CODE>, and <CODE>yylook()</CODE>) and
            asking the C++ compiler to inline them reduced execution
            time by 37% on Sun systems.  I have therefore added
            <CODE>INLINE</CODE> directives to the definitions and
            declarations of those functions (except
            <CODE>yyinput()</CODE> and <CODE>yylook()</CODE>, which are
            in <SAMP>lex</SAMP> / <SAMP>flex</SAMP> -generated code).

        <P>
            With the current version (SC4.0) of the Sun Solaris C++
            compiler, <CODE>inline</CODE> directives do not seem to

            One optimization that looked promising, but actually made
            the program run slightly slower, was to add additional
            patterns for the commonest tags (I chose the top 73 from a
            frequency-ordered list of all of the tags used in the Web
            tree at <SAMP>http://www.math.utah.edu/</SAMP>), and then
            have an action that cached the formatting function, e.g.,

            <CODE>(DO_TAG2()</CODE> is still defined in
            <SAMP>htmlpty.l</SAMP>), instead of looking it up each time
            as <CODE>do_tag()</CODE> does.  Even though this greatly
            reduced the number of calls to
            <CODE>get_action_by_name()</CODE>, it appears that the
            additional complexity in the lexical analyzer made up for
            that gain, and resulted in a slower program.

            attribute on two arrays:
        </P>
<PRE>
	static yyconst short int huge yy_nxt[15842] =
	static yyconst short huge yy_chk[15842] =
</PRE>
        <P>
            Microsoft C 5.0 and 5.1 compile in the huge model, but
            <SAMP>htmlpty</SAMP> goes into an infinite loop.  Microsoft
            C 6.0 produces the above fatal internal error message.
        </P>
        <P>
            <SAMP>tcc</SAMP> 2.0 won't compile at all:  it seems to
            permit the huge attribute only on pointers, not on array
            objects.
        </P>
        <P>
            <SAMP>tcc</SAMP> 3.0 will compile the code in the compact
            and huge memory models, provided that <KBD>-Dconst=</KBD> is
            used to eliminate some apparent type conflict errors.  I
            don't understand what is happening here: running the
            <SAMP>tcc</SAMP> <SAMP>cpp</SAMP> (C preprocessor) on the
            code shows that <CODE>yyconst</CODE> expands to <CODE>const
            </CODE> through most of the code, then expands to an empty
            string in the rest, without ever having been redefined!
        </P>
        <P>
            The resulting executable from the <SAMP>tcc</SAMP> 3.0
            compilation runs, and passes the validation suite.
        </P>
        <P>
            I then tried the <SAMP>lex</SAMP> -generated <SAMP>htmlpty.c
            </SAMP>, adding the <CODE>huge</CODE> attribute to these
            three lines:
        </P>
<PRE>
        int huge yyvstop[] = {
        struct yywork { YYTYPE verify, advance; } huge yycrank[] = {
        struct yysvf huge yysvec[] = {
</PRE>
        <P>
            This compiled and linked with <SAMP>tcc</SAMP> 3.0, but the
            output is incorrect.
        </P>
        <P>
            Conclusion:  the only workable compiler that I have for
            building <SAMP>html-pretty</SAMP> on the IBM PC is Turbo C
            3.0.
        </P>
        <P>
            Trapping of the warning and error messages sent to stderr
            requires the Microsoft <SAMP>errout</SAMP> executable; it is
            used in the <SAMP>pccheck.bat</SAMP> script.
        </P>
        <P>
            For version 1.00, I prepared <SAMP>PC/config.h</SAMP> by
            hand and got a successful build with Turbo C 3.0.  All but
            one of the validation tests passed.  The single failure is
            <SAMP>check016</SAMP>, whose nested style files seem to
            exhaust PC memory, causing it to hang completely without
            getting a failure return from <CODE>fopen()</CODE>.  By
            experiment, I found that if I replaced the line
        </P>

-stylefile check016.st4

        <P>
            then the test would produce the expected results.  I don't
            have time or patience to pursue a workaround for this, but
            the limitation does not seem serious anyway, since style
            files nested deeper than two levels are unlikely to be
            necessary in practice, and relatively trivial to avoid.
        </P>
        <P>
            The batch file <SAMP>Test/docheck.bat</SAMP> can be used to
            run the checks.  PC DOS lacks an adequate file difference
            utility, so I ran the difference tests on a UNIX system
            using a simple <SAMP>csh</SAMP> / <SAMP>tcsh</SAMP> loop:

        <P>
            Before running this loop, it may be necessary to change test
            file line terminators to either DOS CR-LF or UNIX LF
            conventions, perhaps using the
            <SAMP>dos2ux</SAMP>/<SAMP>ux2dos</SAMP> utilities available

            Perhaps some PC installer will be able to build the program
            under newer compilers that avoid the obnoxious 64K segment
            limit, and send me a <SAMP>.exe</SAMP> file and a
            <SAMP>.bat</SAMP> file to build that program, for

            The <SAMP>fuzz</SAMP> package, which essentially feeds
            random garbage to a program's input stream, has turned up
            bugs in numerous UNIX utilities, and was able to make many
            of them core dump, and in at least one case, was able to
            crash the entire operating system.

            Despite wide availability of the <SAMP>fuzz</SAMP> package
            after the 1990 paper, five years later, many of the same
            bugs were found in commercial UNIX systems; the system that
            fared the best in the <SAMP>fuzz</SAMP> tests was the Free
            Software Foundation's GNU system.
