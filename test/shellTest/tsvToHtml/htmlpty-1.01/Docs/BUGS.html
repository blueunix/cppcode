        <P>
            The DVI form of the manual page documentation has some
            deficiencies in line breaking in the <STRONG>SYNOPSIS
            </STRONG> section.  The reason is that neither I, nor a
            colleague who is a long-time <SAMP>troff</SAMP> expert, has
            found a way to format that section with automatic line
            breaking, in such a way that the code works with <SAMP>
            nroff</SAMP>, <SAMP>troff</SAMP>, and <SAMP>groff</SAMP>.
            The explicit line breaks that are present in the
        </P>

        <P>
            conditionals assume normal ASCII output with fixed-width
            characters (<SAMP>nroff</SAMP>: <KBD>.if n ...</KBD>), or
            else Times fonts (<SAMP>troff</SAMP>: <KBD>.if t ...</KBD>).
        </P>
        <P>
            The DVI file is created with Computer Modern fonts, which
            are available in every TeX implementation, but
            <SAMP>groff</SAMP> provides no way to change the fonts
            used in DVI output.  Changing fonts changes character
            widths, and that in turn invalidates the hard-coded line
            breaking decisions.
