            <SAMP>html-pretty</SAMP> (or <SAMP>htmlpty</SAMP> on file
            systems with unpleasant filename length restrictions) is a
            prettyprinter for HTML and SGML.  It can also assist in the
            conversion of ordinary text files in ASCII or ISO8859-1
            character sets to HTML.
        </P>
        <P>
            There is extensive documentation on the program in the UNIX
            manual pages, which are provided in the distribution in
            <SAMP>nroff</SAMP> / <SAMP>troff</SAMP> form, in ASCII form,
            in TeX DVI form, in PostScript form, in PDF form, and in
            HTML form.  The
            <A HREF="../htmlpty-12.html#HDR.12">
                <STRONG>SEE ALSO</STRONG>
            </A>
            section of the manual pages contains pointers to sources of
            HTML and SGML software and bibliographic data.
        </P>
        <P>
            Details on building, testing, and installing the program are
            in the
            <A HREF="INSTALL.html">
                <SAMP>INSTALL</SAMP>
            </A>
            file, but on many UNIX systems, all that it takes is a
            one-line command:
        </P>
<PRE>
     ./configure &amp;&amp; make all check install
