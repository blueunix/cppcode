% This is the html-pretty style file catalog.
% 
% Each line consists of two tokens (a grammar level, and a filename in
% this directory), separated by whitespace, after comments, beginning
% with a percent, and running to end-of-line, are stripped.
% 
% The style files MUST be in the same directory as the catalog file,
% since the path of the catalog file will be prefixed to the filenames
% below to make a full filename.
% 
% This indirect mapping of grammar levels to style files enhances
% customizability and portability, and removes the need for end users
% to know anything about the names or locations of the style files.
% All they need specify is the grammar level.
% 
% SGML files are also located by SGML parsers at run-time using a
% similar catalog.

% Please keep this list alphabetically ordered: the levels are
% displayed in an error message when an unknown level is requested.
