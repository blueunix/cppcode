            256-character set test

        <P>
            The purpose of this test file is to check the handling of
            all 256 characters in an 8-bit character set, because some
            lex implementations are known to have problems with
            characters in the 128..255 range.
        </P>
        <P>
            It is expected that NUL (character 0) will disappear from
            the output of html-pretty, since NUL is not representable in
            C and C++ character strings, nor in character strings in
            some awk implementation, because it serves as a string
            terminator character.  However, all other characters should
            be handled transparently.
        </P>
        <P>
            Not all of these characters are legal in SGML, since the
            SGML character set is restricted by the rules in html.decl
            like this:
        </P>

            When html-ncheck is run on this file, it complains about
            these illegal characters:  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 11 12 14 15 16
            17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 127 128 129 130

            This list exactly matches the DESCSET definitions above.
