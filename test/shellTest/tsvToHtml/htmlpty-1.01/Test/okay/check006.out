            A Beginner's Guide to URLs
        </H1>
        <P>
            What's a URL?  A URL is a <B>Uniform Resource Locator</B>.
            Think of it as a networked extension of the standard <I>
            filename</I> concept: not only can you point to a file in a
            directory, but that file and that directory can exist on any
            machine on the network, can be served via any of several
            different methods, and might not even be something as simple
            as a file:  URLs can also point to queries, documents stored
            deep within databases, the results of a <I>finger</I> or <I>
            archie</I> command, or whatever.
        </P>
        <P>
            Since the URL concept really pretty simple (&quot;if it's
            out there, we can point at it&quot;), this beginner's guide
            is just a quick walk through some of the more common URL
            types and should allow you to be creating and understanding
            URLs in a variety of contexts very quickly.
        </P>
        <H2>
            File URLs
        </H2>
        <P>
            Suppose there is a document called &quot;foobar.txt&quot;;
            it sits on an anonymous ftp server called &quot;
            ftp.yoyodyne.com&quot; in directory &quot;/pub/files&quot;.
            The URL for this file is then:
        </P>
<PRE>
    file://ftp.yoyodyne.com/pub/files/foobar.txt
</PRE>
        The toplevel directory of this FTP server is simply:
<PRE>
    file://ftp.yoyodyne.com/
</PRE>
        The &quot;pub&quot; directory of this FTP server is then:
<PRE>
    file://ftp.yoyodyne.com/pub
</PRE>
        That's all there is to it.
        <H2>
            Gopher URLs
        </H2>
        <P>
            Gopher URLs are a little more complicated than file URLs,
            since Gopher servers are a little tricker to deal with than
            FTP servers.  To visit a particular gopher server (say, the
            gopher server on gopher.yoyodyne.com), use this URL:
        </P>
<PRE>
    gopher://gopher.yoyodyne.com/
</PRE>
        Some gopher servers may reside on unusual network ports on their
        host machines.  (The default gopher port number is 70.) If you
        know that the gopher server on the machine &quot;
        gopher.banzai.edu&quot; is on port 1234 instead of port 70, then
        the corresponding URL would be:
<PRE>
    gopher://gopher.banzai.edu:1234/
</PRE>
        <H2>
            News URLs
        </H2>
        <P>
            To point to a Usenet newsgroup (say, &quot;rec.gardening
            &quot;), the URL is simply:
        </P>
<PRE>
    news:rec.gardening
</PRE>
        Currently, network clients like
        <A NAME=1
            HREF="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SDG/Software/Mosaic/Docs/help-about.html">
            NCSA Mosaic
        </A>
        don't allow you to specify a news server like you would normally
        expect (e.g., <CODE>news://news.yoyodyne.com/rec.gardening
        </CODE> ); this may be coming down the road but in the meantime
        you will have to specify your local news server via some other
        method.  The most common method is to set the environment
        variable <CODE>NNTPSERVER</CODE> to the name of your news server
        before you start Mosaic.
        <H2>
            HTTP URLs
        </H2>
        <P>
            HTTP stands for HyperText Transport Protocol.  HTTP servers
            are commonly used for serving hypertext documents, as HTTP
            is an extremely low-overhead protocol that capitalizes on
            the fact that navigation information can be embedded in such
            documents directly and thus the protocol itself doesn't have
            to support full navigation features like the FTP and Gopher
            protocols do.
        </P>
        <P>
            A file called &quot;foobar.html&quot; on HTTP server &quot;
            www.yoyodyne.com&quot; in directory &quot;/pub/files&quot;
            corresponds to this URL:
        </P>
<PRE>
    http://www.yoyodyne.com/pub/files/foobar.html
</PRE>
        The default HTTP network port is 80; if a HTTP server resides on
        a different network port (say, port 1234 on www.yoyodyne.com),
        then the URL becomes:
<PRE>
    http://www.yoyodyne.com:1234/pub/files/foobar.html
</PRE>
        <H2>
            Partial URLs
        </H2>
        <P>
            Once you are viewing a document located somewhere on the
            network (say, the document <CODE>
            http://www.yoyodyne.com/pub/afile.html</CODE> ), you can use
            a <I>partial</I>, or <I>relative</I>, URL to point to
            another file in the same directory, on the same machine,
            being served by the same server software.  For example, if
            another file exists in that same directory called &quot;
            anotherfile.html&quot;, then <CODE>anotherfile.html</CODE>
            is a valid partial URL at that point.
        </P>
        <P>
            This provides an easy way to build sets of hypertext
            documents.  If a set of hypertext documents are sitting in a
            common directory, they can refer to one another (i.e., be
            hyperlinked) by just their filenames -- <I>however</I> a
            reader got to one of the documents, a jump can be made to
            any other document in the same directory by merely using the
            other document's filename as the partial URL at that point.
            The additional information (access method, hostname, port
            number, directory name, etc.) will be <I>assumed</I> based
            on the URL used to reach the first document.
        </P>
        <H2>
            Other URLs
        </H2>
        <P>
            Many other URLs are possible, but we've covered the most
            common ones you might have to construct by hand.  At the top
            of each Mosaic document viewing window is a text field
            called &quot;Document URL&quot;; if you watch the contents
            of that as you navigate through information on the network,
            you'll get to observe how URLs are put together for many
            different types of information.
        </P>
