<A NAME="NotCovered">
<H3>What this primer doesn't cover</H3>
</A>

This primer assumes that you have:
<UL>
<LI> at least a passing knowledge of how to use NCSA
     Mosaic or other WWW browser 
<LI> a general understanding of how World Wide Web servers
     and client browsers work and
<LI> access to a World Wide Web server for
     which you would now like to produce HTML documents
</UL>

<A NAME="CreatingHTML">
<H3>Creating HTML documents</H3>
</A>

HTML documents are in plain text format and can be created using any
text editor (e.g., Emacs or vi on Unix machines). 
A couple of WWW browsers (tkWWW for X Window System machines and
CERN's WWW browser for the NeXT) do include rudimentary HTML editors
in a WYSIWYG environment, and you may want to try one of them first
before delving into the details of HTML.  <P>

<blockquote>
<i>
You can preview documents in progress with NCSA Mosaic (and some other
WWW browers). 
Open the document using the Open Local option under the <b>File</b> menu. 
Use the Filters,
Directories, and Files fields to locate the document or
enter the path and name of the document in the 
Name of Local Document to Open field. Press OK.
</i>

<P>
If you see
edits you want to make, enter them in the source file. Save the changes.
Return to NCSA Mosaic and press the <b>Reload</b> button on the
bottom menu. The edits are reflected in the on-screen display.
</P>

</blockquote>

<A NAME="MinimalHTML">
<H2>The minimal HTML document</H2>
</A>

Here is a barebones example of HTML:  <P>
____________________________________________________________________
<PRE>
  &lt;TITLE>The simplest HTML example&lt;/TITLE>

  &lt;H1>This is a level one heading&lt;/H1>

  Welcome to the world of HTML.  
  This is one paragraph.&lt;P>

  And this is a second.&lt;P>
</PRE>
____________________________________________________________________
<p>
<A NAME=10 HREF="/General/Internet/WWW/MinimalHTML.html">Click here</A> to see the formatted
version of the example.
<p>

HTML uses <dfn>tags</dfn> to tell the World Web viewer how to display
the text. The above example uses 

<UL>
<LI> the <code>&lt;TITLE></code> tag (which
has a correspondinging <code>&lt;/TITLE></code> tag), which specifies
the title of the document,
<LI>the <code>&lt;H1></code> header tag
(with corresponding <code>&lt;/H1></code>), and
<LI>the <code>&lt;P></code> end-of-paragraph tag.
</UL>

HTML tags consist of a left angular bracket (<code>&lt;</code>), known
as a ``less than'' symbol to mathematicians, followed by some text
(called the <dfn>directive</dfn>) and closed
by a right angular bracket (<code>></code>). 
Tags are usually paired, e.g. <code>&lt;H1></code> and <code>&lt;/H1></code>.
 
The ending tag looks just like the starting tag except 
a slash (/) precedes the text within the brackets.  
In the example, <code>&lt;H1></code> tells the viewer to
start formatting a top level heading; 
<code>&lt;/H1></code> tells the viewer that the heading is complete. 
<P>

The primary exception to the pairing rule is the <code>&lt;P></code>
end-of-paragraph tag.  There is no such thing as <code>&lt;/P></code>.<P>

<strong>Note:</strong> HTML is <EM>not</EM> case senstive. 
<code>&lt;title></code> is completely equivalent
to <code>&lt;TITLE></code> or <code>&lt;TiTlE></code>.  <P>

Not all tags are supported by all World Wide Web browsers.
If a browser does not support a tag, it should just ignore it, though.  <P>

<A NAME="Titles">
<H3>Titles</H3>
</A>
Every HTML document should have a title. A title is generally
displayed separately from
the document and is used primarily for document identification in other
contexts (e.g., a WAIS search). Choose about half a dozen
words that describe the document's purpose.

<blockquote>
<i>
In NCSA Mosaic, the Document Title field is at the top of the screen 
just below the pulldown menus.
</i>
</blockquote>

The directive for the title tag is <code>&lt;title&gt;</code>.
The title generally goes on the first line of the document.  <P>

<A NAME="Headings">
<H3>Headings</H3>
</A>
HTML has six
levels of headings (numbered 1 through 6), with 1 being the most prominent.
Headings are displayed in larger and/or bolder fonts than the normal
body text. The first heading in each document should be tagged 
<code>&lt;H1></code>.

The syntax of the heading tag is:
<PRE>
  &lt;H<var>y</var>><var>Text of heading</var>&lt;/H<var>y</var>>
</PRE>
where <var>y</var> is a number between 1 and 6 specifying the level
of the heading.  <P>

For example, the coding for the ``Headings'' section heading above is
<PRE>
  &lt;H3>Headings&lt;/H3>
</PRE>

<strong>Title versus first heading</strong>: 
In many documents (including this one), the first heading is identical
to the title. For multi-part documents, the text of the first heading
should be suitable for a reader who is already browsing
related information (e.g., a chapter title), while the title 
tag should identify the node in a wider context (e.g., include
both the book title and the chapter title).  <P>

<A NAME="Paragraphs">
<H3>Paragraphs</H3>
</A>

Unlike documents in most word processors, 
carriage returns and white space in HTML files aren't significant.
Word wrapping can occur at any point in your source file, and multiple
spaces are collapsed into a single space. Notice that in the barebones example,
the first paragraph is coded as <P>
<PRE>
  Welcome to HTML.
  This is the first paragraph. &lt;P>
</PRE>
In the source file, there is a line break between the sentences. 
A Web browser ignores this line break and starts
a new paragraph only when it reaches a <code>&lt;P></code> tag.  <P>

<strong>Important:</strong>
You must end each paragraph with <code>&lt;P></code>. The viewer
ignores any indentations or blank lines in the source text. Without
the <code>&lt;P></code> tags, the document becomes one large paragraph. HTML
relies almost entirely on the tags for formatting instructions. (The
exception is text tagged as ``preformatted,'' explained
<A NAME=12 HREF="#Preformatted">below</A>.) For instance, the following
would produce identical output as the first barebones HTML example:   <P>
________________________________________________________________________
<PRE>
  &lt;TITLE>The simplest HTML example&lt;/TITLE>&lt;H1>This is a level 
  one heading&lt;/H1>Welcome to the world of HTML. This is one 
  paragraph.&lt;P>And this is a second.&lt;P>
</PRE>
________________________________________________________________________
<P>

However, to preserve readability in HTML files, headings should be 
on separate lines, and paragraphs should be separated by blank lines. <P>

<A NAME="Links">
<H2>Linking to other documents</H2>
</A>

The chief power of HTML comes from its ability to <dfn>link</dfn> regions
of text (and also images) to another document (or an image). 
These regions are typically
highlighted by the browser to indicate that they are hypertext links.

<blockquote>
<i>
In NCSA Mosaic, hypertext links are in color and underlined by default.
It is possible to modify this in the Options menu as well as in your 
.Xdefaults file.
</i>
</blockquote>

HTML's single hypertext-related directive is <code>A</code>,
which stands for anchor. To include anchors in your document: <P>

<OL>
<LI> Start by opening the anchor with the leading angle bracket
        and the anchor directive followed by a space: <code>&lt;a</code>
<LI> Specify the document that's being pointed to by giving the
        parameter
        <code> href="filename.html" </code> followed by a 
        closing angle bracket: <code>&gt;</code>
<LI> Enter the text that will serve as the hypertext
        link in the current document
        (i.e., the text that will be in a
        different color and/or underlined)
<LI> Enter the ending anchor tag: <code>&lt;/A&gt;</code>
</OL>

Below is an sample hypertext reference:  <P>

<PRE>
  &lt;a href="MaineStats.html"&gt;Maine&lt;/a&gt;
</PRE>

This entry makes ``Maine'' the hyperlink to the document
<samp>MaineStats.html</samp>.  <P>

<A NAME="URL">
<H3>Uniform Resource Locator</h3>
</A>

A Uniform Resource Locator (URL) refers to the format used by WWW
documents to locate other files. A URL gives the type of resource being
accessed (e.g., gopher, WAIS) and the path of the file. The format used is:<p>

<pre>
<var>scheme</var>://<var>host.domain</var>[:<var>port</var>]/<var>path</var>/<var>filename</var>
</pre>

where <dfn>scheme</dfn> is one of: 
<DL>
<DT> <code>file</code>
<DD> a file on your local system, or a file on an anonymous ftp server
<DT> <code>http</code>
<DD> a file on a World Wide Web server
<DT> <code>gopher</code>
<DD> a file on a Gopher server
<DT> <code>WAIS</code>
<DD> a file on a WAIS server
</DL>
The scheme can also be <code>news</code> or <code>telnet</code>, but these
are used much less often than the above.

The port number can generally be omitted from the URL.  <P>

For example if you wanted to insert a link to this primer, you would insert
<PRE>
  &lt;A HREF="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/General/Internet/WWW/HTMLPrimer.html">
  NCSA's HTML Primer&lt;/A>
</PRE>
into your document. This would make the text ``NCSA's HTML Primer'' 
a hyperlink leading to this document.  <P>
 
Refer to the 
<A HREF="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Addressing/Addressing.html">
Addressing</a> document prepared by CERN for additional 
information about URLs.
<cite>A Beginner's
<A HREF="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/demoweb/url-primer.html">Guide</a>
to URLs</cite> is located
on the NCSA Mosaic Help menu.   <P>
<A NAME="NamedAnchorOther">
<h3> Anchors to Specific Sections in Other Documents</h3>
</A>
Anchors can also be used to move to a particular section in 
a document. 

Suppose you wish to set a link from document A and a specific
section in document B. First you need to set up what is called
a <dfn>named anchor</dfn> in document B. For example, to add an
anchor named ``Jabberwocky" to document B, you would insert 

<PRE>
  Here's &lt;A NAME="Jabberwocky"&gt;some text&lt;/a&gt;.
</PRE>

Now when you create the link in document A, you include not
only the filename, but also the named anchor, separated by a hash
mark(``#''):

<PRE>
    This is my &lt;A HREF="documentB.html#Jabberwocky"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;.
</PRE>

Now clicking on the word ``link'' in document A
would send the reader directly to the words ``some text'' in document B.

<A NAME="NamedAnchorSame">
<h3> Anchors to Specific Sections within the Current Document</h3>
</A>

The technique is exactly the same except the file name is now
omitted.  <P>

<strong>Note:</strong> The NCSA Mosaic <b>Back</b> button does not work 
for an anchor within
a document because the <b>Back</b> button is designed to move
to a previous document. Move back manually within the document using the 
scroll bar. <p> 


<H2>
<A NAME="MoreTags">Additional markup tags</A>
</H2>
The above is sufficient to produce simple HTML documents. For more
complex documents, HTML also has tags for several types of lists, 
extended quotes, character formatting and other items, all described
below.

<H3>
<A NAME="Lists">
Lists
</A>
</H3>

HTML supports unnumbered, numbered, and descriptive lists.
For list items, no
paragraph separator is required. The tags for the items in the list 
terminate each list item.

<A NAME="UnnumberedLists">
<h4> Unnumbered Lists </h4>
</A>

<oL>
<LI> Start with an opening list <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> tag.
<LI> Enter the <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> tag followed by the
individual item. (Remember that no closing tag is needed.)
<LI> End with a closing list <code>&lt;/ul&gt;</code> tag.
</oL>

Below an example two-item list:  <P>

<PRE>
  &lt;UL&gt;
  &lt;LI&gt; apples
  &lt;LI&gt; bananas
  &lt;/UL&gt;
</PRE>

The output is:<p>
<ul>
<li>apples
<li>bananas
</ul>
<p>

Note that different viewers display an unordered list differently. A viewer
might use bullets, filled circles, or dashes to show the items. <p>

<A NAME="NumberedLists">
<h4>Numbered Lists </h4>
</A>

A numbered list (also called an ordered list, from where the
abbreviation comes) uses the <code>&lt;ol&gt;</code>
directive to start a list 
rather than the <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> directive.  The items are
tagged using the same <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> tag as for a bulleted list. 
For example:  <P>

<PRE>
  &lt;OL&gt;
  &lt;LI&gt; oranges
  &lt;LI&gt; peaches
  &lt;LI&gt; grapes
  &lt;/OL&gt;
</PRE>

The list looks like this online:<p>
<ol>
<li>oranges
<li>peaches
<li>grapes
</ol>
<p>

<A NAME="DescriptiveLists">
<h4>Descriptive Lists </h4>
</A>

A description list usually consists of alternating a <dfn>description
title</dfn> (abbreviated as dt) and a <dfn>description description</dfn> 
(abbreviated
as dd). The description generally starts on a new line, because the viewer
allows the full line width for the contents of the dt field.<P>

Below is an example description list as included in your source file:  <P>

<PRE>
  &lt;DL&gt;
  &lt;DT&gt; National Center for Supercomputing Applications
  &lt;DD&gt; NCSA is located on the campus of the University 
  of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. NCSA is a one of 
  four member institutions in the National Metacenter for 
  Computational Science and Engineering.
  &lt;DT&gt; Cornell Theory Center
  &lt;DD&gt; CTC is located on the campus of Cornell 
  University in Ithaca, New York. CTC is another member 
  of the National Metacenter for  Computational Science 
  and Engineering.
  &lt;/DL&gt;
</PRE>

The output looks like this: <P>

<DL>
<DT> National Center for Supercomputing Applications
<DD> NCSA is located on the campus of the University of Illinois
     at Urbana-Champaign. NCSA is a one of four member institutions in the
     National Metacenter for Computational Science and Engineering.
<DT> Cornell Theory Center
<DD> CTC is located on the campus of Cornell University in Ithaca,
New York. 
     CTC is another member of the National Metacenter for Computational 
     Science and Engineering.
</DL>

The <code>&lt;DT&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;DD&gt;</code> 
entries can contain multiple
paragraphs (separated by paragraph tags), lists, or other description
information.  <P>

<A NAME="NestedLists">
<h4> Nested Lists </h4>
</A>

Lists can be arbitrarily nested. A list item can itself contain
lists. You can also have a number of paragraphs, each themselves containing
nested lists, in a single list item, and so on. <p>

Remember that the display of an unordered list varies with the 
viewer. A browser may not provide
successive levels of indentation or modify the bullets used at each level. 

<blockquote>
<i>
NCSA
Mosaic indents the second level in the following list and changes
the ``bullet'' from a bullet to a small box.
</i>
</blockquote>

An example nested list:  <P>

<PRE>
  &lt;UL&gt;
  &lt;LI&gt; A few New England states:
    &lt;UL&gt;
    &lt;LI&gt; Vermont
    &lt;LI&gt; New Hampshire
    &lt;/UL&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; One Midwestern state:
    &lt;UL&gt;
    &lt;LI&gt; Michigan
    &lt;/UL&gt;
  &lt;/UL&gt;
</PRE>

The nested list is displayed as  <P>

<UL>
<LI> A few New England states:
<UL>
<LI> Vermont
<LI> New Hampshire
</UL>
<LI>One Midwestern state:
<UL>
<LI> Michigan
</UL>
</UL>

<A NAME="Preformatted">
<H3>Preformatted Text</H3>
</A>

Use the <code>pre</code> tag (which stands for ``preformatted'')
to include text in a fixed-width font and to cause
spaces, new lines, and tabs to be significant. This is
useful for program
listings. For
example, the following lines in your source file: <P>

<pre>
&lt;PRE&gt;
  #!/bin/csh                           
  cd $SCR                             
  cfs get mysrc.f:mycfsdir/mysrc.f   
  cfs get myinfile:mycfsdir/myinfile   
  fc -02 -o mya.out mysrc.f           
  mya.out                              
  cfs save myoutfile:mycfsdir/myoutfile 
  rm *                                
&lt;/PRE&gt;
</pre>

display as:

<PRE>
  #!/bin/csh                           
  cd $SCR                             
  cfs get mysrc.f:mycfsdir/mysrc.f   
  cfs get myinfile:mycfsdir/myinfile   
  fc -02 -o mya.out mysrc.f           
  mya.out                              
  cfs save myoutfile:mycfsdir/myoutfile 
  rm *                                
</PRE>

Hypertext references (and other HTML tags)
can be used within &lt;pre&gt; sections.

<A NAME="Blockquote">
<H3>Extended quotes</H3>
</A>

Use the <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/blockquote&gt;</code> 
tags to include
quotations in a separate block on the screen.  <P>

For example
<PRE>
  &lt;blockquote>
  Let us not wallow in the valley of despair. I say to you, my
  friends, we have the difficulties of today and tomorrow. &lt;P>

  I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the
  American dream. &lt;P>

  I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and 
  live out the true meaning of its creed. We hold these truths 
  to be self-evident that all men are created equal. &lt;P>
  &lt;/blockquote>
</PRE>

The result is
<blockquote>
Let us not wallow in the valley of despair. I say to you, my
friends, we have the difficulties of today and tomorrow.<P>

I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the
American dream.<P>

live out the true meaning of its creed. We hold these 
truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal.<P>
</blockquote>

<A NAME="Addresses">
<H3>Addresses</H3>
</A>

The <code>&lt;ADDRESS></code> tag is generally used 
within HTML documents to specify
the author of a document and provides a means of contacting the author (e.g.,
an email address). This is usually the last item in a file and generally 
starts on a new, left-justified line. <P>
 
For example, the last part of the HTML file for this primer is
<PRE>
  &lt;ADDRESS&gt;
  A Beginner's Guide to HTML / NCSA / pubs@ncsa.uiuc.edu
  &lt;/ADDRESS&gt;
</PRE>

The result is:<p> 
<address>A Beginner's Guide to HTML / NCSA / pubs@ncsa.uiuc.edu</address> <P>

<A NAME="CharFormat">
<H3>Character formatting</H3>
</A>

Individual words or sentences can be put in special styles. 
<dfn>Logical</dfn> styles are
those that are configured by your viewer.  For example, 
<code>&lt;CITE&gt;</code>
may be defined as italic by your viewer. Each time you enter 
<code>&lt;CITE&gt;</code>
tags, the viewer automatically displays the text in italics. <p>

A <dfn>physical</dfn> style
is one that you determine, and the viewer displays 
what you have coded. For example
<code>&lt;I&gt;</code> tells the viewer to 
display your text in italics. <P>

For HTML-coded documents, you should use 
logical styles whenever possible. Future
implementations of HTML may not implement physical styles at all. <p>
 
<UL>
<li>Italic
  <ul>
  <LI> <code>&lt;I&gt;text&lt;/i&gt;</code> puts text in italics
        (<i>HTML Primer</i>)
  <li> <code>&lt;em&gt;text&lt;/em&gt;</code> also italicizes text (only <em>one</em> viewer)
  <li> <code>&lt;cite&gt;text&lt;/cite&gt;</code> is used for citations of names
        of manuals, sections, or books (<cite>HTML Primer</cite>)
  <li> <code>&lt;var&gt;text&lt;/var&gt;</code> indicates a 
        variable (<var>filename</var>)
</ul>
<li>Bold  
  <ul>
  <LI> <code>&lt;b&gt;text&lt;/b&gt;</code> puts text in bold
        (<b>Important</b>)
  <li> <code>&lt;strong&gt;text&lt;/strong&gt;</code> also emphasizes
   text (<strong>Note:</strong>)
   </ul>
<li>Fixed width font
   <ul>
   <LI> <code>&lt;tt&gt;text&lt;/tt&gt;</code> puts text in a fixed-width 
        font (<tt>1 SU = 1 CPU hour</tt>)
   <LI> <code>&lt;code&gt;text&lt;/code&gt;</code> also puts text in 
        a fixed-width font (<code>1 SU = 1 CPU hour</code>)
   <li> <code>&lt;samp&gt;text&lt;/samp&gt;</code> formats text for samples
        (<samp>-la</samp>)
   <li> <code>&lt;kbd&gt;text&lt;/kbd&gt;</code> displays the names of 
         keys on the keyboard (<kbd>HELP</kbd>)
       </ul>
<li>Other (the following special tag currently does not display in NCSA Mosaic)
    <ul>
    <li> <code>&lt;dfn&gt;text&lt;/dfn&gt;</code> 
         displays a definition in italics 
    </ul>
</UL>

<A NAME="SpecialChar">
<H3>Special Characters</H3>
</A>

Three <A NAME=characters>characters</A> out of the entire ASCII (or ISO 8859) character set
are <i>special</i> and cannot be used ``as-is'' within an HTML document.
These characters are left angle bracket (<code>&lt;</code>), right
angle bracket (<code>&gt;</code>), and ampersand (<code>&amp;</code>).  <P>

The angle brackets are used to specify HTML tags (as
shown above), while the ampersand is used as the escape mechanism
for these and other characters:

<UL>
<LI> <code>&amp;lt;</code> is the <i>escape sequence</i> for 
        <code> &lt;</code>
<LI> <code>&amp;gt;</code> is the escape sequence for 
        <code> &gt;</code>
<LI> <code>&amp;amp;</code> is the escape sequence for 
        <code> &amp;</code>
</UL>

Note that ``escape sequence'' means that the given sequence of
characters represents the single character in an HTML document and that 
the semicolon is required. The
conversion to the single character itself takes place when the
document is formatted for display by a reader.  <P>

There are additional escape sequences, such as 
a whole set of sequences to support
8-bit character sets (ISO 8859-1). For example:

<UL>
<LI> <code>&amp;ouml;</code> is the escape sequence for 
        a lowercase <code>o</code> with an umlaut: &ouml;
<LI> <code>&amp;ntilde;</code> is the escape sequence for 
        a lowercase <code>n</code> with an tilde: &ntilde;
<LI> <code>&amp;Egrave;</code> is the escape sequence for 
        an uppercase <code>E</code> with a grave mark: &Egrave;
</UL>

Many such escapes exist and are available in a <A NAME=2

 from CERN.  <P>


<A NAME="InlineImage">
<H2>Inline Images</H2>
</A>

NCSA Mosaic is can display X Bitmap (XBM) or GIF format images inside 
documents. <i>Each image
takes time to process and slows down the initial display of the
document</i>. Using a particular image multiple times in a document
causes very little performance degradation compared to using the image only once. <P>

<b>NOTE:</b> The <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag is an HTML extension 
first implemented in NCSA Mosaic. Currently it is not
understood by most other World
Wide Web browsers.  <P>

To include an inline image in your document, enter:  <P>

<PRE>
    &lt;IMG SRC="filename.GIF"&gt;
</PRE>
<p>

<img src="filename.GIF"> By default the bottom of an image is aligned with
the text as shown in this paragraph.
<p>

<img align=top src="filename.GIF"> Include the <code>align=top</code> 
parameter if you want the viewer 
to align adjacent text with the top of the
image as shown in this paragraph. The full inline image
tag with the top alignment is: 
<pre>
    &lt;IMG ALIGN=top SRC="filename.GIF"&gt;
</pre>
<p>
If you have a larger image 
(i.e., one that fills most of your screen),
you should insert an end of paragraph tag (<code>&lt;p&gt;</code>) before 
inserting the image parameter. End with another paragraph tag. 
(Or you might want to have the 
image open a new window, which is explained below.)
</p>

<A NAME="ExternalImage">
<h3> External Images </h3>
</A>

You may want to have an image open as a separate document when a user
activates a link on either a word or a smaller version of the image 
that you have inlined
into your document. This is considered an external image and is particularly
useful because (assuming you use a word for your hypertext link) 
you do not have 
any processing time degradation in the main document. Even if you include a
small image in your document as the hyperlink 
to the larger image, the processing
time for the ``postage stamp'' image is less than the full image.<p>

To include a reference to a graphic in an external document, use 
<pre>
    &lt;A HREF = "filename.gif"&gt;link anchor&lt;/A&gt;
</pre> <p> 
Make certain the image
is in GIF, TIFF, JPEG, RGB, or HDF format.

<A NAME="Troubleshooting">
<H2>Troubleshooting</H2>
</A>
<UL>
<LI> While certain HTML constructs can be nested (for example, you
        can have an anchor within a header), they cannot be overlapped.
        For example, the following is <i>invalid</i> HTML:
<PRE>
    &lt;h1&gt;This is &lt;a name="foo"&gt;invalid HTML.&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
</PRE>
     Because many current HTML parsers aren't very good at handling
        invalid HTML, avoid overlapping constructs. <p>
        
<LI> In NCSA Mosaic, when an <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag points at 
        an image that does not
        exist or cannot be otherwise obtained from whatever server
        is supposed to be serving it, the NCSA logo is substituted. 
        For example, entering <code>&lt;img href="DoesNotExist.gif"&gt;
        </code> (where
        "DoesNotExist.gif" is a nonexistant file) causes the following to
        be displayed: <IMG SRC="DoesNotExist.gif">  <P>

        If this happens to you, first make sure that the referenced
        image does in fact exist and that the hyperlink has the correct
        information in the link entry. 
        Next verify that the file permission is set appropriately 
        (world-readable). 
</UL>

<A NAME="ExtendedExample">
<H2>A Longer Example</H2>
</A>

Here is a longer example
of a HTML document:  <P>
________________________________________________________________________
<PRE>
  &lt;TITLE>A Longer Example&lt;/TITLE>
  &lt;H1&gt;A Longer Example&lt;/H1&gt;

  This is a simple HTML document. This is the first
  paragraph. &lt;P&gt;

  This is the second paragraph, which shows special effects.  This is a 
  word in &lt;I&gt;italics&lt;/I&gt;.  This is a word in &lt;B&gt;bold&lt;/B&gt;.
  Here is an inlined GIF image: &lt;IMG SRC="myimage.gif"&gt;. 
  &lt;p&gt;

  This is the third paragraph, which demonstrates links.  Here is 
  a hypertext link from the word &lt;A HREF="subdir/myfile.html"&gt;foo&lt;/A&gt;
  to a document called "subdir/myfile.html". &lt;P&gt;  (If you 
  try to follow this link, you will get an error screen.)

  &lt;H2&gt;A second-level header&lt;/H2&gt;

  Here is a section of text that should display as a 
  fixed-width font: &lt;P&gt;

  &lt;PRE&gt;
      On the stiff twig up there
      Hunches a wet black rook
      Arranging and rearranging its feathers in the rain ...
  &lt;/PRE&gt;

  This is a unordered list with two items: &lt;P&gt;

  &lt;UL&gt;
  &lt;LI&gt; cranberries
  &lt;LI&gt; blueberries
  &lt;/UL&gt;

  This is the end of my example document. &lt;P&gt;

  &lt;address&gt;Me (me@mycomputer.univ.edu)&lt;/address&gt;
