<p> In this section, we begin the specification of HTML 4.0,
starting with the contract between authors, documents, users, and user
agents. 

<P>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in <a rel="biblioentry"
href="./references.html#ref-RFC2119">[RFC2119]</a>.  However, for
readability, these words do not appear in all upper case letters in
this specification.

<P>At times, the authors of this specification recommend good practice
for authors and user agents.  These recommendations are not normative
and conformance with this specification does not depend on their
realization. These recommendations contain the expression "We
recommend ...", "This specification recommends ...", or some similar
wording.

<H2><a name="h-4.1">4.1</a> Definitions</H2>

<dl>
<dt><dfn><strong>HTML document</strong></dfn>
<dd>An HTML document is an SGML document that meets
the constraints of this specification.

<dt><dfn><strong>Author</strong></dfn>
<dd>An author is a person or program that
writes or generates HTML documents.

<dt><dfn><strong>User</strong></dfn> 
<dd>A user is a person who interacts with a user agent to view, hear,
or otherwise use a rendered HTML document.</dd>

<dt><dfn><strong>HTML user agent</strong></dfn>
<dd>An HTML user agent is any device that
interprets HTML documents. User agents include visual browsers
(text-only and graphical), non-visual browsers (audio, Braille), search
robots, proxies, etc. 

<P>A <em>conforming user agent</em> for HTML 4.0 is one that observes
the mandatory conditions ("must") set forth in this specification,
including the following points:

<ul>
<li>A user agent should avoid imposing arbitrary length limits on
attribute value literals (see the section on capacities in the <a
href="sgml/sgmldecl.html">SGML Declaration</a>). For introductory
information on SGML attributes, please consult the section on <a
href="../intro/sgmltut.html#attrib-defs">attribute definitions</a>.

<li>A user agent must ensure that rendering is unchanged by the
presence or absence of start tags and end tags when the HTML DTD
indicates these are optional. See the section on <a
href="../intro/sgmltut.html#element-defs">element definitions</a> for
introductory information on SGML elements.
</ul>
</dd>

<dt><dfn><strong>Error conditions</strong></dfn>
<DD>This specification does not define how conforming user agents
handle general error conditions, including how user agents
behave when they encounter elements, 
attributes, attribute values, or
entities not specified in this document. 

<P>However, to facilitate experimentation and interoperability between
implementations of various versions of HTML, we recommend the
following behavior:</P>

<ul>
<li>If a user agent encounters an element it does not recognize,
it should try to render the element's content.
<li>If a user agent encounters an attribute it does not recognize,
it should ignore the entire attribute specification (i.e., the attribute
and its value).
<li>If a user agent encounters an attribute value it doesn't recognize,
it should use the default attribute value.
<li>If it encounters an undeclared entity, the entity should be
treated as character data.
</ul>

<P>We also recommend that user agents provide support for notifying
the user of such errors.

<P>Since user agents may vary in how they handle error conditions,
authors and users must not rely on specific error recovery behavior.

<dt><a name="deprecated"><dfn><strong>Deprecated</strong></dfn></a>
<dd>A deprecated element or attribute is one
that has been outdated by newer constructs. Deprecated elements are
defined in the reference manual in appropriate locations, but are
clearly marked as deprecated. Deprecated elements may become obsolete in
future versions of HTML. 

<P>User agents should continue to support deprecated elements for
reasons of backward compatibility.

<p>Definitions of elements and attributes clearly indicate which are
<a href="#deprecated">deprecated</a>. 

<P>This specification includes examples that illustrate how to avoid
using deprecated elements. In most cases these depend on user agent
support for style sheets. In general, authors should use style sheets
to achieve stylistic and formatting effects rather than HTML
presentational attributes. HTML presentational attributes have been
deprecated when style sheet alternatives exist (see, for example, <a
rel="biblioentry" href="../references.html#ref-CSS1">[CSS1]</a>).
</dd>

<dt><dfn><strong>Obsolete</strong></dfn>
<dd>An obsolete element or attribute is one
for which there is no guarantee of support by a user agent. Obsolete
elements are no longer defined in the specification, but are listed for
historical purposes in the <a href="appendix/changes.html">changes
section</a> of the reference manual.
</dd>
</dl>


<H2><a name="h-4.2">4.2</a> <a name="sgmlconvent">SGML</a></H2>

<P>HTML 4.0 is an SGML application conforming to International
Standard ISO 8879 -- <dfn>Standard Generalized Markup Language</dfn>
SGML (defined in <a rel="biblioentry"
href="../references.html#ref-ISO8879">[ISO8879]</a>). 

<p>Comments appearing in the <a href="./sgml/dtd.html">HTML 4.0 DTD</a>
have no normative value; they are informative only. 

<P>User agents must not render SGML processing instructions (e.g.,
&lt;?full volume&gt;) or comments. For more information about this
and other SGML features that may be legal in HTML but aren't widely
supported by HTML user agents, please consult the section on <a
href="appendix/notes.html#sgmlfeatures">SGML features with limited
support.</a>

<H2><a name="h-4.3">4.3</a> <a name="text-html">The text/html content type</a></H2>

<P>HTML documents are sent over the Internet as a sequence of bytes
accompanied by encoding information (described in the section on <a
href="charset.html#encodings">character encodings</a>).  The structure
of the transmission, termed a <a name="message-entity"><em>message
entity</em></a>, is defined in <a rel="biblioentry"
href="./references.html#ref-RFC2045">[RFC2045]</a>) and <a
rel="biblioentry" href="references.html#ref-RFC2068">[RFC2068]</a>.  A
message entity with a <a href="types.html#type-content-type">content
type</a> of "text/html" represents an HTML document.

<P>The content type for HTML documents is defined as follows:

<dl>
<dt><em>Content type name</em>
<dd>text</dd>
<dt><em>Content subtype name</em>
<dd>html</dd>
<dt><em>Required parameters</em>
<dd>none</dd>
<dt><em>Optional parameters</em>
<dd>charset</dd>
<dt><em>Encoding considerations</em>
<dd>any encoding is allowed</dd>
<dt><em>Security considerations</em>
<dd>See the <a href="appendix/notes.html#notes-security">notes on
security</a></dd>
</dl>

<P>The optional parameter "charset" refers to the <a
href="charset.html#encodings">character encoding</a> used to represent
the HTML document as a sequence of bytes. Legal values for this
parameter are defined in the section on <a
href="charset.html#encodings">character encodings</a>. Although this
parameter is optional, we recommend that it always be present.

<div class="note"><P> 
<em><strong>Note.</strong> The relationship
between this specification's encoding of <a
href="struct/text.html#line-breaks">line breaks</a> and <a
rel="biblioentry" href="./references.html#ref-RFC2045">[RFC2045]</a>,
section 2.10 is not yet clear. The editors expect to review this
relationship during the Proposed Recommendation review phase.
</em>

<!-- This used to be here, but I think it's
better described immediately below -IJ

           The charset parameter (as defined in section 7.1.1 of
            RFC 1521[MIME]) may be given to specify the character
            encoding scheme used to represent the HTML document as a
            sequence of octets. The default value is outside the
            scope of this specification; but for example, the
            default is `US-ASCII' in the context of MIME mail, and
            `ISO-8859-1' in the context of HTTP [HTTP].
