<h2><a name="h-A.1">A.1</a> Changes to elements</h2> 

<h3><a name="h-A.1.1">A.1.1</a> New elements</h3> 

<p>The new elements in this version of HTML are <samp
class="einst">Q</samp>, <samp class="einst">INS</samp>, <samp
class="einst">DEL</samp>, <samp class="einst">ABBR</samp>, <samp
class="einst">LEGEND</samp>, <samp class="einst">COLGROUP</samp>, 
<samp class="einst">BUTTON</samp>, <samp class="einst">OPTGROUP</samp>, and
<samp class="einst">FIELDSET</samp>.

<h3><a name="h-A.1.2">A.1.2</a> <a href="../convent.html#deprecated">Deprecated</a> elements</h3>

<p>The following elements are now <a
href="../convent.html#deprecated">deprecated</a>: <samp
class="einst">ISINDEX</samp>, <samp class="einst">APPLET</samp>, <samp
class="einst">CENTER</samp>, <samp class="einst">FONT</samp>, <samp
class="einst">BASEFONT</samp>, <samp class="einst">STRIKE</samp>,
<samp class="einst">S</samp>, <samp class="einst">U</samp>, <samp
class="einst">DIR</samp>, and <samp class="einst">MENU</samp>.

<h3><a name="h-A.1.3">A.1.3</a> Obsolete elements</h3>

<p>The following elements are now obsolete: <samp
class="einst">XMP</samp>, <samp class="einst">PLAINTEXT</samp>, and
<samp class="einst">LISTING</samp>. For all of them, you should use
the <samp class="einst">PRE</samp> element instead.

<h2><a name="h-A.2">A.2</a> <a name="table_changes">Changes to Tables</a></h2>

<p>The HTML 4.0 table model has grown out of early work on HTML+ and
the initial draft of <a
href="../references.html#ref-HTML30">HTML3.0</a>. The earlier 
model has been extended in response to requests from information
providers for improved control over the presentation of tabular
information:

<ul>
    <li>The ability to align on designated characters such as "." and":"<br> 
        (e.g., aligning a column of numbers on the decimal point).

    <li>The need for more flexibility in specifying table frames and rules.

    <li>The need for incremental display of large tables as data is received.

    <li>The ability to support scrollable tables with fixed headers
        plus better support for breaking tables across pages for printing.

    <li>The need for optional column based defaults for alignment properties
</ul>

<p>In addition, a major goal has been to provide backwards
compatibility with the widely deployed Netscape implementation of
tables. Another goal has been to simplify importing tables
conforming to the SGML CALS model.  The latest draft makes the <samp
class="ainst-TABLE">align</samp> attribute compatible with the
latest versions of the most popular browsers.  Some clarifications
have been made to the role of the <samp class="ainst-TABLE">dir</samp>
attribute attribute and recommended behavior when absolute and
relative column widths are mixed.

<p>A new element, <samp class="einst">COLGROUP</samp>, has been
introduced to allow sets of columns to be grouped with different width
and alignment properties specified by one or more <samp
class="einst">COL</samp> elements. The semantics of <samp
class="einst">COLGROUP</samp> have been clarified over previous
drafts, and <tt>rules="basic"</tt> replaced by <tt>rules="groups"</tt>.

<p>The <samp class="ainst-TABLE">style</samp> attribute is included as a
means for extending the properties associated with edges and interiors
of groups of cells. For instance, the line style: dotted, double,
thin/thick etc; the color/pattern fill for the interior; cell margins
and font information. This will be the subject for a companion specification
on style sheets.

<p>The <samp class="ainst-TABLE">frame</samp> and <samp
class="ainst-TABLE">rules</samp> attributes have been modified to avoid SGML
name clashes with each other, and to avoid clashes with the <samp
class="ainst-TABLE">align</samp> and <samp class="ainst">valign</samp>
attributes. These changes were additionally motivated by the desire to
avoid future problems if this specification is extended to allow <samp
class="ainst-TABLE">frame</samp> and <samp class="ainst-TABLE">rules</samp>
attributes with other table elements.

<h2><a name="h-A.3">A.3</a> <a name="form_changes">Changes to Forms</a></h2>

<p>The forms specified in HTML 3.2 have the following problems:

<ul>
<li>There is no provision for keyboard shortcuts for particular actions,
for access keys for driving menus, etc.

<li>Although form controls can be made insensitive dynamically, they cannot
be declared as such at initialization time.

<li>Along the same line form controls, such as form fields, cannot be made
"read only".

<li>Labels for radio buttons and checkboxes are not sensitive, i.e.,
clicking on a label text doesn't effect the button state.

<li>There is no way to markup groups of related form fields in a way that
effectively supports browsing with speech-based user agents.

<li>There is no provision for checking values as they are entered into form
fields. All checking is done at the server when the form's contents are
submitted.

<li>Nothing is provided to specify what type of data file is expected when
the user is asked to submit files.

<li>Forms can only contain the two buttons submit and reset.

<li>There is no way to specify what character sets the server issuing
a form can handle.
</ul>


<p>To solve these problems this specification introduces several new
attributes and elements.

<ul>
<li>The <samp class="ainst-LABEL">accesskey</samp> attribute provides for
specifying direct keyboard access to form fields.

<li>The <samp class="ainst-LABEL">disabled</samp> attribute allows
form providers to make a form control initially insensitive.

<li>And with the additional attribute <samp
class="ainst-INPUT">readonly</samp>, authors can prohibit changes to a
form field.

<li>The <samp class="einst">LABEL</samp> element associates a label
with a particular form control.  The <samp
class="einst">FIELDSET</samp> element groups related fields together
and, in association with the <samp class="einst">LEGEND</samp>
element, can be used to name the group.  Both of these new elements
allow better rendering and better interactivity. Speech-based browsers
can better describe the form and graphic browsers can make labels
sensitive.

<li>A new set of attributes, including <samp
class="ainst">onchange-INPUT</samp>, in association with support for
scripting languages, allows form providers to verify user-entered data.

<li>The <samp class="einst">INPUT</samp> element has a new attribute
<samp class="ainst-INPUT">accept</samp> that allows authors to specify a
list of valid content types or type patterns for the input.

<li>The new <samp class="einst">BUTTON</samp> element can be used to
make richer forms with more than just a submit and a reset button.

<li>The <samp class="einst">FORM</samp> element includes the attribute
<samp class="ainst-FORM">accept-charset</samp>, modeled on the HTTP
"Accept-Charset" header (see <a rel="biblioentry"
href="../references.html#ref-RFC2068">[RFC2068]</a>). This attribute
(first proposed in <a rel="biblioentry"
href="../references.html#ref-RFC1867">[RFC1867]</a>) may be used to
specify a list of character sets acceptable to the server.
</ul>

<h2><a name="h-A.4">A.4</a> Changes for internationalization</h2> 

<P>HTML 4.0 takes into account recommendations of <a rel="biblioentry"
href="../references.html#ref-RFC2070">[RFC2070]</a> for the
internationalization of HTML.
