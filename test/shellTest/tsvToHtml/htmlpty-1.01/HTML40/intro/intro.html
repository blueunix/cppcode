<H2><a name="h-2.1">2.1</a> What is the World Wide Web?</h2>
<p>The World Wide Web is a network of information resources. The Web
relies on three mechanisms to make these resources readily available to
the widest possible audience: 

<ol>
<li>A uniform naming scheme for locating resources on the Web (e.g., URLs).
<li>Protocols, for access to named resources over the Web (e.g., HTTP).
<li>Hypertext, for easy navigation among resources (e.g., HTML).
</ol>

<P>The ties between the three mechanisms are apparent throughout
this specification. 

<H3><a name="h-2.1.1">2.1.1</a> <a href="intro-urls">Introduction to URLs</a></H3>
<p>Every resource available on the Web -- HTML document, image, video
clip, program, etc. -- has an address that may be encoded by a 
<dfn>Uniform Resource Locator</dfn>, or "URL".

<P>URLs typically consist of three pieces:

<ol>
<li> The naming scheme of the mechanism used to access the resource. 
<li> The name of the machine hosting the resource.
<li> The name of the resource itself, given as a path.
</ol>

<P>Consider the URL that designates the current HTML specification:

<pre>
http://www.w3.org/TR/PR-html4/cover.html
</pre>

<P>This URL may be read as follows: There is a document available via
the HTTP protocol (see <a rel="biblioentry"
href="./references.html#ref-RFC2068">[RFC2068]</a>), residing on the
machine www.w3.org, accessible via the path
"/TR/PR-html4/cover.html". Other schemes you may see in HTML documents
include "mailto" for email and "ftp" for FTP.

<DIV class="example">
<P>Here is another example of a URL. This one refers to
a user's mailbox:</P>

<PRE>
<EM>...this is text...</EM>
For all comments, please send email to 
&lt;A href="mailto:joe@someplace.com"&gt;Joe Cool&lt;/A&gt;.
</PRE>
</DIV>


<h3><a name="h-2.1.2">2.1.2</a> <a name="fragment-url">Fragment identifiers</a></h3>

<P>Some URLs refer to a location within a resource.  This kind of URL
ends with "#" followed by an anchor identifier (called the "fragment
identifier"). For instance, here is a URL pointing to an anchor named
<samp>section_2</samp>:</P>

<pre class="example">
http://somesite.com/html/top.html#section_2
</pre>

<h3><a name="h-2.1.3">2.1.3</a> <a name="relative-urls">Relative URLs</a></h3>

<p>A <dfn>relative</dfn> URL doesn't contain any naming scheme
information. Its path generally refers to a resource on the same
machine as the current document. Relative URLs may contain relative
path components (".." means one level up in the hierarchy defined by
the path), and may contain fragment identifiers.

<P>Relative URLs are <a
href="../struct/links.html#resolving-relative-urls">resolved to full
URLs</a> using a base URL. As an example of relative URL resolution,
assume we have the base URL
"http://www.acme.com/support/intro.html". The relative URL in the
following markup for a hypertext link:</p>

<pre>
  &lt;A href="suppliers.html"&gt;Suppliers&lt;/A&gt;
</pre>

<p>would expand to the full URL "http://www.acme.com/support/suppliers.html",
while the relative URL in the following markup for an image</p>

<pre>
  &lt;IMG src="../icons/logo.gif" alt="logo"&gt;
</pre>

<p>would expand to the full URL "http://www.acme.com/icons/logo.gif".

<P>In HTML, URLs play a role in these situations:

<ul>
<li> linking to another document or resource,
(see the <a href="../struct/links.html#edef-A"><samp class="einst">A</samp></a> and
<a href="../struct/links.html#edef-LINK"><samp class="einst">LINK</samp></a> elements).

<li> linking to an external style sheet or script (see the
<a href="../struct/links.html#edef-LINK"><samp class="einst">LINK</samp></a> and
<a href="../interact/scripts.html#edef-SCRIPT"><samp class="einst">SCRIPT</samp></a> elements).

<li> images, objects and applets for inclusion in a page, (see the
<a href="../struct/objects.html#edef-IMG"><samp class="einst">IMG</samp></a>, <a href="../struct/objects.html#edef-OBJECT"><samp class="einst">OBJECT</samp></a>,
<a href="../struct/objects.html#edef-APPLET"><samp class="einst">APPLET</samp></a> and
<a href="../interact/forms.html#edef-INPUT"><samp class="einst">INPUT</samp></a> elements).

<li> image maps (see the <a href="../struct/objects.html#edef-MAP"><samp class="einst">MAP</samp></a>
and <a href="../struct/objects.html#edef-AREA"><samp class="einst">AREA</samp></a> elements).

<li> form submission (see <a href="../interact/forms.html#edef-FORM"><samp class="einst">FORM</samp></a>).

<li> frames (see the <a href="../present/frames.html#edef-FRAME"><samp class="einst">FRAME</samp></a> and
<a href="../present/frames.html#edef-IFRAME"><samp class="einst">IFRAME</samp></a> elements).

<li> citing an external reference (see the
<a href="../struct/text.html#edef-Q"><samp class="einst">Q</samp></a>, <a href="../struct/text.html#edef-BLOCKQUOTE"><samp class="einst">BLOCKQUOTE</samp></a>,
<a href="../struct/text.html#edef-ins"><samp class="einst">INS</samp></a> and
<a href="../struct/text.html#edef-del"><samp class="einst">DEL</samp></a> elements).

<li> referring to metadata conventions describing a document
(see the <a href="../struct/global.html#edef-HEAD"><samp class="einst">HEAD</samp></a> element).
</ul>

<P>Please consult the section on the <a
href="../types.html#type-url">URL</a> type for more information about
URLs.

<H2><a name="h-2.2">2.2</a> What is HTML?</h2>
<P> To publish information for global distribution, one needs a
universally understood language, a kind of publishing mother tongue
that all computers may potentially understand. The publishing language
used by the World Wide Web is HTML (from HyperText Markup Language).

<P>HTML gives authors the means to:

<UL>
<LI>Publish online documents with headings, text, tables, lists,
photos, etc.

<LI>Retrieve online information via hypertext links, at the click of a
button.

<LI>Design forms for conducting transactions with remote services, for
use in searching for information, making reservations, ordering
products, etc.

<LI>Include spread-sheets, video clips, sound clips, and other
applications directly in their documents.
</UL>

<H3><a name="h-2.2.1">2.2.1</a> A brief history of HTML</H3>
<P> HTML was originally developed by Tim Berners-Lee while at
CERN, and popularized by the Mosaic browser developed at NCSA.
During the course of the 1990s it has blossomed with the explosive
growth of the Web. During this time, HTML has been extended in a
number of ways. The Web depends on Web page authors and vendors
sharing the same conventions for HTML. This has motivated joint
work on specifications for HTML.

<P>HTML 2.0 (November 1995, see <a rel="biblioentry"
href="../references.html#ref-RFC1866">[RFC1866]</a>) was developed
under the aegis of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) to
codify common practice in late 1994. HTML+ (1993) and <a
rel="biblioentry" href="../references.html#ref-HTML30">[HTML30]</a>
(1995) proposed much richer versions of HTML. Despite never receiving
consensus in standards discussions, these drafts led to the adoption
of a range new features. The efforts of the World Wide Web
Consortium's HTML working group to codify common practice in 1996
resulted in HTML 3.2 (January 1997, see <a rel="biblioentry"
href="../references.html#ref-HTML32">[HTML32]</a>). Changes from HTML
3.2 are summarized in <a href="../appendix/changes.html">Appendix A</a>

<P>Most people agree that HTML documents should work well across
different browsers and platforms. Achieving interoperability lowers
costs to content providers since they must develop only one version of
a document. If the effort is not made, there is much greater risk
that the Web will devolve into a proprietary world of incompatible
formats, ultimately reducing the Web's commercial potential for all
participants.

<P>Each version of HTML has attempted to reflect greater consensus
among industry players so that the investment made by content
providers will not be wasted and that their documents will not become
unreadable in a short period of time.

<P>HTML has been developed with the vision that all manner of devices
should be able to use information on the Web: PCs with graphics
displays of varying resolution and color depths, cellular
telephones, hand held devices, devices for speech for output and 
input, computers with high or low bandwidth, and so on.</P>

<H2><a name="h-2.3">2.3</a> HTML 4.0</H2>
<P> HTML 4.0 extends HTML with mechanisms for style sheets, scripting,
frames, embedding objects, improved support for right to left and mixed
direction text, richer tables, and enhancements to forms, offering
improved accessibility for people with disabilities.

<H3><a name="h-2.3.1">2.3.1</a> Internationalization</H3>

<P>This version of HTML has been designed with the help of experts in
the field of internationalization, so that documents may be written in
every language and be transported easily around the world. This has
been accomplished by incorporating <a rel="biblioentry"
href="../references.html#ref-RFC2070">[RFC2070]</a>, which deals with
the internationalization of HTML.

<P>One important step has been the adoption of the ISO/IEC:10646
standard (see <a rel="biblioentry"
href="../references.html#ref-ISO10646">[ISO10646]</a>) as the document
character set for HTML. This is the world's most inclusive standard
dealing with issues of the representation of international characters,
text direction, punctuation, and other world language issues.

<P>HTML now offers greater support for diverse human languages within
a document. This allows for more effective indexing of documents for
search engines, higher-quality typography, better text-to-speech
conversion, correct hyphenation, etc.

<H3><a name="h-2.3.2">2.3.2</a> Accessibility</H3>

<P>As the Web community grows and its members diversify in their
abilities and skills, it is crucial that the underlying
technologies be appropriate to their specific needs. HTML
has been designed to make Web pages more accessible to
those with physical limitations. HTML 4.0 developments in
the area of accessibility include:</P>

<UL> 
<LI>Encouraging the use of style sheets (rather than tables) to achieve
layout effect.

<LI>Making it easier to provided alternate (textual and aural)
descriptions of images for non-visual browsers.

<LI>Providing labels for form fields

<LI>Providing labeled hierarchical groupings for form fields. 

<LI>Providing the ability to associate a longer text description with an
HTML element.
</UL>

<P>Authors who design pages with accessibility issues in mind will not 
only receive the blessings of the accessibility community, but will
benefit in other ways as well: well-designed HTML
documents that distinguish structure and presentation will
adapt more easily to new technologies.

<H3><a name="h-2.3.3">2.3.3</a> Tables</H3>

<P>The new table model in HTML is based on <a rel="biblioentry"
href="../references.html#ref-RFC1942">[RFC1942]</a>.  Authors now
have greater control over structure and layout (e.g., column groups).
The ability of designers to recommend column widths
allows user agents to display table data incrementally (as it arrives)
rather than waiting for the entire table before
rendering.

<div class="note">
<em><strong>Note.</strong> At the time of writing, some HTML authoring
tools rely extensively on tables for formatting, which may easily
cause accessibility problems.
</em>
</div>

<H3><a name="h-2.3.4">2.3.4</a> Compound documents</H3>

<P>HTML now offers a standard mechanism for embedding generic media
objects and applications in HTML documents. The <a href="../struct/objects.html#edef-OBJECT"><samp
class="einst">OBJECT</samp></a> element (together with its more specific
ancestor elements <a href="../struct/objects.html#edef-IMG"><samp class="einst">IMG</samp></a> and <a href="../struct/objects.html#edef-APPLET"><samp
class="einst">APPLET</samp></a>) provides a mechanism for including
images, video, sound, mathematics, specialized applications, and other
objects in a document. It also allows authors to specify a hierarchy
of alternate renderings for user agents that don't support a specific
rendering.

<H3><a name="h-2.3.5">2.3.5</a> Style sheets</H3>

<P>Style sheets simplify HTML markup and largely relieve HTML of the
responsibilities of presentation. They give both authors and users
control over the presentation of documents -- font
information, alignment, colors, etc.

<P>Style information can be specified for specific elements or
groups of elements either within an HTML document or in 
separate style sheets.

<P>The mechanism for associating a style sheet with a document is
independent of the style sheet language.

<P>Before the advent of style sheets, authors had limited control over
rendering.  HTML 3.2 included a number of attributes and elements
offering control over alignment, font size, and text color. Authors
also exploited tables and images as a means for laying out pages. The
relatively long time it takes for users to upgrade their browsers
means that these features will continue to be used for some
time. However, since style sheets offer more powerful presentation
mechanisms, the World Wide Web Consortium will eventually phase out
many of HTML's presentation elements and attributes.  Throughout the
specification elements and attributes at risk are marked as "<a
href="../convent.html#deprecated">deprecated</a>".  They are usually
accompanied by examples of how to achieve the same effects with
other elements or style sheets.

<p>This specification includes three Document Type Definitions (DTDs)
that may be used to validate HTML 4.0 documents. One for use with
framesets, a loose DTD for transitional documents and a strict DTD
that excludes presentation elements and attributes.

<H3><a name="h-2.3.6">2.3.6</a> Scripting</H3>

<p>Through scripts, authors may create "smart forms" that react as users
fill them out. Scripting allows designers to create dynamic Web pages, and
to use HTML as a means to build networked applications. The mechanisms
provided to associate HTML with scripts are independent of particular
scripting languages.

<H3><a name="h-2.3.7">2.3.7</a> Printing</H3>

<P>Sometimes, authors will want to make it easy for users to print more
than just the current document. When documents form part of a larger
work, the relationships between them can be described using the HTML
<a href="../struct/links.html#edef-LINK"><samp class="einst">LINK</samp></a> element or using W3C's Resource
Description Language, see <a href="../references.html#ref-RDF">[RDF]</a>.

<H2><a name="h-2.4">2.4</a> Designing documents with HTML 4.0</H2>

<!-- I wish we could expand this -Ian -->

<P>We recommend that authors and implementors observe the following
general principles when working with HTML 4.0.

<h3><a name="h-2.4.1">2.4.1</a> Separate structure and presentation</h3> 

<P>HTML has its roots in SGML which has always been a language for the
specification of structural markup. As HTML matures, more and more of
its presentational elements and attributes are being replaced by other
mechanisms, in particular style sheets. Experience has shown that
separating the structure of a document from its presentational aspects
reduces the cost of serving a wide range of platforms, media, etc., and
facilitates document revisions.</p>

<h3><a name="h-2.4.2">2.4.2</a> Consider universal accessibility to the Web</h3> 

<P>To make the Web more accessible to everyone, notably those with
disabilities, authors should consider how their documents may be
rendered on a variety of platforms: speech-based browsers,
braille-readers, etc. We do not recommend that designers limit their
creativity, only that they consider alternate renderings in their
design. HTML offers a number of mechanisms to this end (e.g., the
<a href="../struct/objects.html#adef-alt"><samp class="ainst">alt</samp></a> attribute, the 
<a href="../interact/forms.html#adef-accesskey"><samp class="ainst">accesskey</samp></a> attribute, etc.)

<P>Furthermore, authors should keep in mind that their documents may
be reaching a far-off audience with different computer
configurations. In order for documents to be interpreted correctly,
designers should include in their documents information about the
natural language and direction of the text, how the document is
encoded, and other issues related to internationalization.</p>

<h3><a name="h-2.4.3">2.4.3</a> Help user agents with incremental rendering</h3> 

<P>By carefully designing their tables and making use of new table
features in HTML 4.0, designers can help user agents render documents
more quickly. Authors can learn how to design tables for
incremental rendering in the 
definition of the <a href="../struct/tables.html#edef-TABLE"><samp class="einst">TABLE</samp></a> element. Implementors
should consult the <a href="../appendix/notes.html#notes-tables">notes
on tables</a> in the appendix for information on incremental algorithms.
