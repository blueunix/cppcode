<h2><a name="h-1.1">1.1</a> How the specification is organized</h2>

<p>This specification is divided into the following sections:

<dl>
<dt><Strong>Sections 2 and 3: Introduction to HTML 4.0</strong>
<dd>The introduction describes HTMLs place in the scheme of the World
Wide Web, provides a brief history of the development of HTML,
highlights what can be done with HTML 4.0, and provides some design
tips for developing good HTML habits.

<P>The brief SGML tutorial gives readers some understanding of 
HTML's relationship to SGML and gives summary information on how to
read the HTML Document Type Declaration (DTD).
</dd>

<dt><strong>Sections 4 - 24: HTML 4.0 reference manual</strong>
<dd>The bulk of the reference manual consists of the HTML language
reference, which defines all elements and attributes of the language.

<P>This document has been organized by topic rather than by the
grammar of HTML. Topics are grouped into three categories: structure,
presentation, and interactivity. Although it is not easy to divide
HTML constructs perfectly into these three categories, the model
reflects the designers' experience that separating a document's
structure from its presentation produces more effective and
maintainable documents.

<P>The language reference consists of the following information:</P>

<ul>

<li><p>What <a href="charset.html#doc-char-set">characters</a> may
appear in an HTML document.</P>

<li><p>Basic <a href="types.html">data types</a> of an HTML document.</P>

<li><p>Elements that govern the structure of an HTML
document, including <a href="./struct/text.html">text</a>, <a
href="./struct/lists.html">lists</a>, 
<a href="./struct/tables.html">tables</a>, 
<a href="./struct/links.html">links</a>, and 
<a href="./struct/objects.html">included objects, images, and applets</a>.</P>

<li><p>Elements that govern the presentation of an HTML document,
including <a href="./present/styles.html">style sheets</a>, <a
href="./present/graphics.html">fonts, colors, rules, and other visual
presentation</a>, and <a href="./present/frames.html">frames for
multi-windowed presentations</a>.</P>

<li><p>Elements that govern interactivity with an HTML document,
including  <a href="./interact/forms.html">forms for user input</a> and
<a href="./interact/scripts.html">scripts for active documents</a>.</P>

<li><p>The SGML formal definition of HTML: 
<ul>
<li>The <a
href="./sgml/sgmldecl.html">SGML declaration of HTML</a>.
<li>Three DTDs: <a href="./sgml/dtd.html">strict</a>,
<a href="./sgml/loosedtd.html">loose</a>, and 
<a href="./sgml/framesetdtd.html">frameset</a>.
<li>The <a
href="./sgml/entities.html">list of character references</a>.
</ul>
</ul>

<dt><strong>Appendixes</strong>

<dd>The first appendix contains information about <a
href="appendix/changes.html">changes from HTML 3.2</a> to help authors
and implementors with the transition to HTML 4.0. The second appendix
contains <a href="appendix/notes.html">performance and implementation
notes</a> and is primarily intended to help implementors create
user agents for HTML 4.0.
</dd>

<dt><strong>References</strong>
<dd>A list of normative and informative references.</dd>

<dt><strong>Indexes</strong>

<dd>Two indexes give readers rapid access to the definition of all <a
href="./index/elements.html">elements</a> and <a
href="./index/attribs.html">attributes</a> The indexes also
summarize some key characteristics of each element and attribute.
</dd>
</dl>

<h2><a name="h-1.2">1.2</a> Document conventions</H2>

<P>This document has been written with two types of readers in mind:
authors and implementors. We hope the specification will
provide authors with the tools they need to write efficient,
attractive, and accessible documents, without over-exposing them to
HTML's implementation details. Implementors, however, should find all
they need to build conforming user agents.

<p>The specification may be approached in several ways:

<ul>
<li><P><strong>Read from beginning to end.</strong> The specification
begins with a general presentation of HTML and becomes more and more
technical and specific towards the end.

<li><strong>Quick access to information.</strong> In order to get
information about 
syntax and semantics as quickly as possible, the online
version of the specification includes the following
features:

<ol>
<li>Every reference to an element or attribute is linked to
its definition in the specification. Each element or attribute
is defined in only one location.

<li>Every page will include links to the indexes, so you will never be
more than two links away from finding the definition of an <a
href="index/elements.html">element</a> or <a
href="index/attribs.html">attribute</a>.

<li><p>The front pages of the three sections of the language reference
manual extend the initial table of contents with more
detail about each section.</P>

</ol>
</ul>

<h3><a name="h-1.2.1">1.2.1</a> Elements and attributes</h3>

<P> Element names are written in upper case letters (e.g.,
BODY). Attribute names are written in lower case letters (e.g., lang,
onsubmit). Recall that in HTML, element and attribute names are
case-insensitive; the convention is meant to encourage readability.

<p>Element and attribute names are marked within the source HTML for
the specification and may be rendered specially by some user
agents.

<p>Each attribute definition specifies the type of its value. If
the type allows a small set of possible values, the definition
lists the set of values, separated by a bar (|).

<P>After the type information, each attribute
definition indicates the case-sensitivity of its values, between "[]"
marks. See the section on <a href="types.html#case">case
information</a> for details.

<h3><a name="h-1.2.2">1.2.2</a> Notes and examples</h3>

<P>Informative notes are emphasized to stand out from surrounding
text and may be rendered specially by some user agents.

<P>All examples illustrating deprecated usage are marked as "DEPRECATED
EXAMPLE". Deprecated examples also include recommended alternate
solutions. All examples that illustrates illegal usage are clearly
marked as "ILLEGAL EXAMPLE".

<P>Examples in the text conform to the <a href="sgml/dtd.html">strict
document type declaration</a> unless otherwise indicated or unless the
example in question refers to elements or attributes only defined by
the <a href="sgml/loosedtd.html">loose document type declaration</a> or
<a href="sgml/framesetdtd.html">frameset document type declaration</a>.
For convenience, most of the examples in this 
specification do not begin with the 
<a href="struct/global.html#version-info">document type declaration</a> that
is mandatory at the beginning of each HTML document.

<P>Examples and notes are marked within the source HTML for the
specification and some user agents may render them specially.

<H2><a name="h-1.3">1.3</a> Acknowledgments</H2>
