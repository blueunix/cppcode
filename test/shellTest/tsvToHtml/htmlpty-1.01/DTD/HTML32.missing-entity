according to <URL:http://www.cs.duke.edu/%7Edsb/kgv-faq/errors.html#bad-entity> they haven't dropped it, it was just forgot.

Cf. <URL:http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/MarkUp/Wilbur/>
which, as I read it, suggests there was somewhat more intention
behind it than merely forgetting it...

And here is what http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/MarkUp/Wilbur/ says:

What happened to &quot;?

Several people have commented on the absence of the &quot; entity in the
HTML 3.2 Recommendation. This disappeared in a rationalization of the
entities, and with hindsight should not have been removed. In general, you
don't need it, and here are two work arounds:

When you want to include a double quote mark in a CDATA attribute value, you
can go ahead and do so provided you use single quote marks around the
attribute value itself, e.g.

     ALT='and then he said "Let it be done" and it was so'

Another approach is to use the numeric entity &#34; as in:

     ALT="and then he said &#34;Let it be done&#34; and it was so"

This latter method is perhaps better suited to authoring tools as it doesn't
depend on any contextual clues and can be used in normal text as well as in
CDATA attribute values.
