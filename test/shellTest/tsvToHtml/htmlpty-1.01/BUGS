The DVI form of the manual page documentation has some deficiencies in
line breaking in the SYNOPSIS section.  The reason is that neither I,
nor a colleague who is a long-time troff expert, has found a way to
format that section with automatic line breaking, in such a way that
the code works with nroff, troff, and groff.  The explicit line breaks
that are present in the

.if n .ti ...
.if t .ti ...

conditionals assume normal ASCII output with fixed-width characters
(nroff: .if n ...), or else Times fonts (troff: .if t ...).  

The DVI file is created with Computer Modern fonts, which are
available in every TeX implementation, but groff provides no way to
change the fonts used in DVI output.  Changing fonts changes character
widths, and that in turn invalidates the hard-coded line breaking
decisions.
