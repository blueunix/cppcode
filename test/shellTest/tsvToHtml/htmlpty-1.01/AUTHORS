The install-sh and mkinstalldirs scripts are public-domain scripts
from the Free Software Foundation's GNU software distributions.

Support for automatic configuration on UNIX systems is provided by the
configure script, which uses files created by the GNU autoheader and
autoconf utilities.  None of these GNU utilities are required to build
this software, but they ARE needed if you want to make changes to the
configure.in file.
