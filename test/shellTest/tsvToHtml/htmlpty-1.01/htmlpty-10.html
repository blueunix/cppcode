Like LaTeX, Lisp, PostScript, and TeX, SGML is an
<EM>extensible</EM>
language.  In particular, at run time, it is possible to redefine the
syntax and semantics of all lexical elements, including the base
character set, the characters that may appear in identifiers, and the
special characters that delimit tags or strings.
<P>
In SGML, this is conventionally done in SGML declaration files for
syntax definitions, and in DTD files, which are analogous to LaTeX
style files.  Low-level typesetting commands of the flavor ``select a
14-point Lucida-BoldItalic font'', ``skip down vertically 6 picas'',
and ``draw a horizontal rule 3 ems long'' are notably absent.  SGML
documents are expected to use only high-level markup commands, leaving
the visual appearance entirely up to the DTD specification, and the
formatting software.
<P>
Unlike LaTeX and TeX, SGML is
<EM>not</EM>
a typesetting system.  It is only a grammar for a standard markup
language, and it is left to SGML software implementors to write DTDs,
and to provide for translation of SGML documents to specific document
formatting, typesetting, or word processing systems.  In this respect,
SGML is similar to the RTF (Rich Text Format) supported by many
popular word processors, in that it can serve as an intermediate
language for electronic document exchange; several language
translators between SGML and other text representations are mentioned
in the
<STRONG>SEE ALSO</STRONG>
section below.  Regrettably, there is wide variation in the
capabilities and document models of current text formatting systems,
so such translations are usually rough approximations that may require
substantial hand patching to make them truly satisfactory.
<P>
HTML is a modest subset of SGML, with tag names apparently chosen from
SGML, the Free Software Foundation's TeXinfo system (which in turn
is modeled on the earlier Scribe document formatting system), and
occasionally, also from LaTeX.
<P>
<STRONG>html-pretty</STRONG>
is written in this spirit: it knows about the meaning and typical
use of all standard HTML tags, but nothing about other SGML DTDs.
However, the style-file facility makes it possible to prepare
formatting rules for
<EM>any</EM>
SGML DTD, extending the applicability of
<STRONG>html-pretty</STRONG>
to the entire world of SGML, provided a tag normalizer such as
<A HREF="../man1/sgmlnorm.html"><STRONG>sgmlnorm</STRONG></A>(1)
or
<A HREF="../man1/spam.html"><STRONG>spam</STRONG></A>(1)
is available to supply omitted tags, and expand abbreviated ones.
However, since SGML tag names depend on the specific DTD, and DTDs
tend to be proprietary,
<STRONG>html-pretty</STRONG>
is not packaged with pre-written style files for SGML.
<P>
Contributions of suitable style files for public SGML DTDs, together
with those DTDs, are hereby solicited, and they may be included in
future releases of
<STRONG>html-pretty</STRONG>.
