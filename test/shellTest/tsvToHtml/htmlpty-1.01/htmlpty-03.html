DESCRIPTION
</A>
</H1>
<P>
<STRONG>html-pretty</STRONG>
filters its HTML or SGML input from
<EM>stdin</EM>,
or from one or more named files given on the command line, and
prettyprints it to
<EM>stdout</EM>,
standardizing the spacing, and providing indentation to expose
the document structure.
<P>
When its input is just a plain text file in the ASCII or ISO 8859-1
character sets, a major part of the conversion of text to
grammatically-correct HTML can be done automatically, especially if the
<STRONG>-convert-paragraph-breaks</STRONG>
option is used.  Section headings, verbatim, and tabular material will,
however, require manual editing.
<P>
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the language used to specify
formatting instructions in text files intended for viewing with
<EM>World-Wide Web</EM>
(WWW) client programs (browsers), such as
<A HREF="../man1/amaya.html"><STRONG>amaya</STRONG></A>(1),
<A HREF="../man1/arena.html"><STRONG>arena</STRONG></A>(1),
<A HREF="../man1/chimera.html"><STRONG>chimera</STRONG></A>(1),
<A HREF="../man1/grail.html"><STRONG>grail</STRONG></A>(1),
<A HREF="../man1/hotjava.html"><STRONG>hotjava</STRONG></A>(1),
<A HREF="../man1/jde.html"><STRONG>jde</STRONG></A>(1),
<A HREF="../man1/lynx.html"><STRONG>lynx</STRONG></A>(1),
<A HREF="../man1/netscape.html"><STRONG>netscape</STRONG></A>(1),
<A HREF="../man1/panorama.html"><STRONG>panorama</STRONG></A>(1),
and
<A HREF="../man1/xmosaic.html"><STRONG>xmosaic</STRONG></A>(1).
<P>
The WWW idea began in late 1992, and because viewer programs support
display of text, line drawings, color raster images, hypertext links,
and uniform access to several Internet services, including file
transfer, in the first two years, the number of WWW servers grew from
zero to several hundred thousand, and some of the more popular sites
receive up to twenty-five million accesses a day from all over the
Internet.  Consequently, many Internet computer users are beginning to
write HTML documents for their own home pages, and
<STRONG>html-pretty</STRONG>
is written for them.
<P>
The goal of a prettyprinter is to recognize all legal inputs, and
produce output that is indented to reflect the structure, and in which
line lengths have been restricted for improved readability.
Irregularities in coding practice, and outright errors, are more likely
to be detected in the prettyprinted output, than in the input.
<P>
SGML (Standard General Markup Language, ISO 8879), and its particular
document type definition instance, HTML, follow a rigorous grammar for
text markup that makes it possible to clearly identify document parts,
such as headings, sections, subsections, paragraphs, figures, tables,
equations, and so on, and files with such standardized markup are
particularly good candidates for prettyprinting.
<P>
The definition of HTML is still evolving.  Version 2.0 (Fall 1994) is
implemented by almost all browsers.  Version 3.0, informally called
HTML Plus, was introduced in March, 1995, and the
<A HREF="../man1/arena.html"><STRONG>arena</STRONG></A>(1)
browser was developed at the World-Wide Web Consortium, W3C, to serve
as a testbed for it.
<P>
Although Version 3.0 is a superset of version 2.0, it proved too
difficult for browser implementors to incorporate support for it in a
reasonable time, and it was withdrawn in Fall, 1996.  Version 3.2 was
released on 14 January 1997, but despite its higher version number, it
lacks many of the new features introduced in version 3.0, notably for
mathematical markup, but importantly, it
<EM>does</EM>
include support for figures and tables.  As with version 3.0, there is
also a testbed browser, this time called
<A HREF="../man1/amaya.html"><STRONG>amaya</STRONG></A>(1),
and augmented with the ability to edit HTML files, providing a
(simple-minded) WYSIWYG editor interface that some users may find
convenient for creating and maintaining HTML files.
<P>
At the time of writing in Fall, 1997, only the
<A HREF="../man1/amaya.html"><STRONG>amaya</STRONG></A>(1)
and
<A HREF="../man1/netscape.html"><STRONG>netscape</STRONG></A>(1)
browsers appear to have implemented all, or most, of HTML 3.2.
<P>

the World-Wide Web at the

The next version of HTML, code-named
<EM>Cougar</EM>,
is under development, and will become version 4.0 when it is finally
released.  The first draft public release was on 8 July 1997, and a
second proposed recommendation followed on 7 November 1997.  For

<P>
<STRONG>html-pretty</STRONG>
recognizes all HTML tags in the grammars of versions 1.0, 2.0,
3.0, 3.2, and proposed 4.0, plus a few vendor-specific extensions.
<P>
One significant difference between the grammar versions is that the
HTML tag
<EM>&lt;P&gt;</EM>
is a
<EM>paragraph separator</EM>
in version 2.0, while it is a
<EM>paragraph begin</EM>
in later versions, and consequently expects to have a matching
<EM>&lt;/P&gt;</EM>
<EM>paragraph end</EM>
tag that is not required in 2.0.
<STRONG>html-pretty</STRONG>
will supply missing
<EM>&lt;/P&gt;</EM>
tags, and delete empty
<EM>&lt;P&gt; ... &lt;/P&gt;</EM>
environments.  Since HTML translators ignore unknown tags, this is
transparent to HTML version 2.0 implementations, and causes no
problems.
<P>
<STRONG>html-pretty</STRONG>
expects that its input is reasonably well-formed. Usually it is
sufficient that the file can be displayed by one or more WWW browsers,
producing the expected form.  However, it would be unwise to write a
large amount of program code without a compiler to check it, and it is
similarly unwise to write documentation in HTML or SGML without at
least a validating parser to ensure that the text is syntactically
correct.
<P>
Fortunately, at least two such programs are publicly available (thanks
to the generosity of their author, James Clark),
<A HREF="../man1/nsgmls.html"><STRONG>nsgmls</STRONG></A>(1)
and
<A HREF="../man1/sgmls.html"><STRONG>sgmls</STRONG></A>(1),
together with UNIX shell scripts,
<A HREF="../man1/html-check.html"><STRONG>html-check</STRONG></A>(1)
and
<A HREF="../man1/html-ncheck.html"><STRONG>html-ncheck</STRONG></A>(1),
to facilitate their use with HTML files.  In addition, the
<A HREF="../man1/nsgmls.html"><STRONG>nsgmls</STRONG></A>(1)
distribution is accompanied by two SGML tag normalizers,
<A HREF="../man1/sgmlnorm.html"><STRONG>sgmlnorm</STRONG></A>(1)
and
<A HREF="../man1/spam.html"><STRONG>spam</STRONG></A>(1),
and there is a UNIX shell script,
<A HREF="../man1/html-spam.html"><STRONG>html-spam</STRONG></A>(1),
for one of them.  You may therefore find it useful to apply
<A HREF="../man1/html-spam.html"><STRONG>html-spam</STRONG></A>(1),
and either
<A HREF="../man1/html-check.html"><STRONG>html-check</STRONG></A>(1)
or
<A HREF="../man1/html-ncheck.html"><STRONG>html-ncheck</STRONG></A>(1),
to your HTML files, and fix all of the errors that they detect, before
filtering the files with
<STRONG>html-pretty</STRONG>.
<P>
HTML strictly requires a certain amount of
<EM>boiler-plate</EM>
to be wrapped around the text, and there is ample evidence that most
HTML files omit these wrappers, because WWW browsers are written to be
tolerant of grammatical deviations.
<STRONG>html-pretty</STRONG>
will supply the wrappers if they are omitted; indeed, if given an
empty input file,
<STRONG>html-pretty</STRONG>
produces output similar to this:

<P>
This example, minus the comments <TT>&lt;!-- ... --&gt;</TT>, shows the
minimal markup that should be expected in an HTML file, although the
grammar permits the HTML, HEAD and BODY environments to be implicitly
assumed if they are omitted.  While most WWW browsers ignore the DOCTYPE
declaration, it is essential for SGML parsers, since it identifies the
grammar rules that apply to what follows.  Two recent WWW browsers,
<A HREF="../man1/amaya.html"><STRONG>amaya</STRONG></A>(1)
and
<A HREF="../man1/panorama.html"><STRONG>panorama</STRONG></A>(1),
are SGML-grammar based, and may require a valid DOCTYPE declaration.
